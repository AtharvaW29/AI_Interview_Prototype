I’m currently on my F-1 STEM OPT, and my EAD is set to expire in the first week of September. Due to my current circumstances, I’m planning to enroll in a Day 1 CPT university. I understand that Day 1 CPT is a grey area, but unfortunately, I don’t have much of a choice right now.

Here’s my situation: I have a family emergency and need to travel to India in the first week of August, just for a week. I’m aware that international travel while being on STEM OPT with only a few weeks left on the EAD is risky — but again, it’s unavoidable.

I’m hoping to hear from others who might have been in a similar situation:

1.  Has anyone traveled while on STEM OPT with only a few months or weeks left before EAD expiry?

2.  What should be my response if the immigration officer asks why I’m returning to the U.S. with only one month left on my EAD?

I understand there’s a possibility of being denied entry, so I’m looking for any tips or suggestions to maximize my chances of being allowed back into the U.S. I’d really appreciate any personal experiences, advice, or insights.

Thank you!

A few things about my background:

* I already have an MBA and an MS degree from reputed institutions (including one from the U.S.)
* I’ve worked in tech and product roles for about 8–10 years
* I have no intent to immigrate immediately — my current goal is research and academic growth

1. I had previously faced issues with a STEM OPT EAD revocation due to a payment error, though we filed an I-290B motion to reopen the case. I had paid them twice for premium processing and they have received it.

I’m currently on my F1 OPT and will be applying for the STEM extension in about 2 months. I graduated with a Master’s in Information Technology Management from a Day 1 CPT college.

When I first came to the U.S., I enrolled in a university for Industrial Engineering. But due to some circumstances, I had to transfer after one semester to a different university where I completed my Master’s in ITM(Information Technology &amp; Management)

Right now, I’ve been actively applying for jobs in IT (my field of study), but haven’t had much luck. However, I just received a job offer from a company for a role that’s not directly related to my Master’s degree. It’s more aligned with my Bachelor’s degree from India (which was in an electro-mechanical-related field).

The role is contract-based, and I’m thinking of taking it temporarily while I continue my job search in IT. Here’s part of the job description below where i picked one point and the rest is electro mechanical related.

“Develops and uses test procedures, including assisting with the definition of test specifications with design / software engineering. May work with test engineering on the design and development of test fixtures. May assist in the coordination of test fixture sourcing activities.”

My concern is: Will taking this job create any issues with my OPT or future STEM extension?
I’m aware the job should be related to my field of study, and while this one may involve some technical aspects, it’s not directly in IT. 

I want to be cautious about anything that could cause problems in the future.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice, I’d really appreciate your input!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

Back in the 2010s, I was familiar with family petitions and the general visa process, but I know a lot has changed over the past few years. I’d really appreciate it if someone could explain the situation below to me like I’m in 5th grade — just to help me better understand it. We’re trying to give some guidance to my wife’s cousin regarding her current immigration status.

Here’s what we know about her:
	•	She came to the U.S. in January 2024 on a B2 tourist visa, and her I-94 was valid for six months.
	•	There’s an I-140 petition filed for her, but we think the priority date is around March 2023.
	•	She requested an extension of her I-94, which was approved.
	•	She then applied for an F-1 student visa.
	•	In March 2025, she got a letter saying her SEVIS record was canceled by the school she applied to.
	•	After that, she received an F-1 approval notice valid from 05/20/2025 for “duration of stay.”

Today is June 19, and we’re wondering what exactly she’s done since her F-1 approval started in May. We’re unsure if she’s just unaware of how the process works or if she’s being a bit stubborn. We want to help, but we don’t want to give bad advice since we don’t fully understand the situation ourselves. At the same time, we’re hesitant to tell her just speak to here immigration lawyer — we don’t want her getting taken advantage of.

What are the risks she’s facing right now?

Common sense is telling me once the F1 visa was approved since 5/20/2025 that she should be filling and focusing on getting ready for school. Are there fly by night school that takes F1 visa students and just taking advantage of loopholes?

We know most of her expenses are being covered by her parents overseas.

A common question is: why do embassies say “no info” but slots still appear?

From what many applicants have seen, embassies often drop slots in small batches to avoid system overloads and reduce no-shows. Staff rarely confirm the schedule because they don’t want people spamming the booking system, and they don’t want complaints if slots change.

Some consulates drop a few slots every day instead of big bulk drops. Slots can open anytime, not just during local business hours.

One rule of thumb if you’re hunting for slots, try checking at unusual local times and around holiday periods.

* Job offer letter (voluntary research position)
* Travel-endorsed I-20 (with a recent travel signature)
* Plan to renew my F-1 visa while home

---

As of June 18, the U.S. Department of State has resumed the scheduling of visa interviews for F, M, and J visa categories, following a 3 week pause on new visa appointment scheduling. 

This resumption of visa issuance includes new and expanded security screening procedures for F-1 visa issuance. 

New Vetting Procedures

According to newly released guidance, consular officers are now instructed to conduct reviews of applicants' online presence as part of the visa screening process. 

Officers are directed to assess for:

Any indications of hostility toward U.S. citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles

Advocacy for or support of foreign terrorist groups or other threats to U.S. national security

Support for or involvement in unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence


These checks apply specifically to nonimmigrant visa applicants in the F (academic student), M (vocational student), and J (exchange visitor) categories. This includes both primary applicants (F-1, J-1, M-1) and dependents (F-2, J-2, M-2).

The updated procedures align with similar guidance issued to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 

What This Means for Applicants

Students who did not previously have visa interviews scheduled can now book appointments.

Applicants may experience longer processing times due to the additional screening requirements and the backlog of applicants. 

It is strongly recommended that applicants ensure their online activity aligns with the information presented during their visa application.

Next Steps

Students are encouraged to stay in close contact with their university’s international student office and to review and consider their social media presence including posts, accounts followed, and liked posts/comments/videos etc. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-resuming-student-visa-appointments-state-dept-official-says-2025-06-18""&gt;Trump administration restarting student visa appointments, State Dept official says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

My professor would be the internship supervisor and everything will be done on-campus (aside from minor field work like sample collection).

If I don't need CPT, I don't think there are any issues.

If I do need CPT, here's my next question:

My program doesn't offer the internship course over the summer, so students 'take' the internship class in the Fall for credit even tho they completed the internship in the summer. This is a bit iffy when it comes to applying for CPT since I'd need to be enrolled in the class before the start date, and before they issue me the CPT I20.

Probably not but I wanted to just lay this all out here. I might not even *need* CPT in my case but wanted to ask anyway if anyone knows.

I don’t have any criminal or immigration violations, I’m not from a country on any travel ban lists, and I haven’t been involved in any political protests or activism. I still have one year left on my F-1 program.

My main concern is:
Will I have any issues returning to the U.S.? I’ve seen recent news about increased scrutiny and secondary inspections at the border, and I’m a bit anxious since this would be my first time trying to re-enter as an F-1 traveler.

I plan to bring:
	•	My valid I-20 (signed for travel)
	•	Valid passport and F-1 visa

I had quite an interesting day at the U.S. Consulate today (Intentionally leaving out the consulate location). I will not be revealing specifics of what happened, but here is how things went for me.  
  
I arrive at the consulate an hour early, although I tried my best to be there just fifteen minutes before the appointment time, as it doesn't matter once you are inside. I was taken to a preliminary processing counter and was cleared to join an hour long queue for the actual interview.

I could overhear things, dramatic discussions, and folks trying their best to make their cases for approval. There were separate queues for F1 and the rest. I saw an old lady trying to convince the officer to approve her B2 visa. It seemed like she was not able to communicate in English, and I saw the VO, a middle-aged white American man, trying to find someone to translate things for her. I was surprised to see that there are no translators available in place, and things need to be arranged beforehand. 

While I was processing all this, I overheard the VO requesting somebody to translate things for her, and then I realised she was from my city. I tried to volunteer but was denied by the facilitators initially. The  VO saw me doing this and asked me to step up to the counter. 

I tried to present her case, but she had overshot her previous B2 stay by 2 years. The VO was very kind and patient with her, but she failed to present all the required documentation and justify her overstay, which I realised then to be a clear violation of the B2 visa terms. She was very devastated as she wanted to enter the US to be with her daughter. The VO asked her to apply again in future and asked me to inform her that immigration laws currently are very tight and her explanation could not justify her overstay (214G incoming).

I was about to get back into my queue, and he asked me for my passport and I-20. After hesitating for a bit there, I handed them over. He did thank me for stepping up and helping the old lady. Let me try transcribing my bit in the usual way :

VO: How many admits did you receive?  
Me: Only one :).  
VO: Oh, alright, what schools did you apply to then?  
Me: Stanford, Berkley, UT Austin...  I started smiling :).  
VO: Ah, you just applied for the big ones :D.  
Me: I did, I was specific in what I wanted, and I wanted to get into a good school.  
VO: Alright, NC state is a good school too :)  
Me: Yup, has a great course work in xxx.   
VO: Alright, thanks for helping out the lady there, that was very kind. Have a good day :)

I don't know what happened next, was partially blank here, stepped away from the counter, I can only recall him telling i will get it back in a week.

Here I am sharing all this, still unable to digest the chain of events. I'm just glad I was able to help her, tried to talk to her daughter, and asked her to arrange translator services if available for her next appointment.

Also, I hope I got my VISA approved too :)

The reason I think why Germany can be a better option is:

1.	⁠low tution cost.
2.	⁠easy pathway to immigration/citizenship
3.	⁠ease of travelling back to homeland without any fear of being denying the access.
4.	⁠Air Travel Time of just 7-8 hours back to home instead of 14 hours.

I know there are also drawbacks like language, weather, low wages but I think in my case the above out weighs the cons with a huge margin.

I am really lost and don’t know what to do, not sure if I’ll get admission for Winter or even next summer and then you have the uncertainity of Visa issuance. 🙁

My biggest fear is I want to travel back home without fearing anything. I’d be happy even with the wages are low (no super low 🥹).

Any word for me? I am not sure what to do.

My GPA for the classes that count towards my degree does meet the required 3.0 threshold, however, the extra classes I was forced to take to maintain full-time student status, is weighing down my GPA and blocking me from graduating.

Unfortunately, I have only recently been informed of this and there is little time left for me to apply for post completion OPT. Regardless, its hard to get a job nowadays and I'll probably just have to return in 3 months even if I did get the OPT anyway, so that's not my biggest concern at the moment; getting my degree is.

While the university is massive, the graduate program I am in is quite small and there were usually just 4-5 classes to choose from for each semester, which meant I was often forced to take classes that I had very little academic interest in or wasn't relevant for my line of work. This issue only became worse in later semesters as I might have already taken some of the classes offered in that semester previously, leaving even less options.

Still, I tried to use this as an opportunity to expand my knowledge base, but focused on my core classes that are actually part of my degree.

I do not need to meet any other requirements or take more credits to complete my degree. With the 30 credits that are counted towards my degree, my GPA does average to a 3 so I should be able to graduate, but they are unwilling to let me as I do not meet their overall GPA requirements.

2. Are there any steps I should take now to ensure my &lt;strong&gt;SEVIS record remains active&lt;/strong&gt; during this waiting period?&lt;br/&gt;

Courts have identified the following seven factors as part of the test:

1. The extent to which the intern and the employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation. Any promise of compensation, express or implied, suggests that the intern is an employee—and vice versa.
2. The extent to which the internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be given in an educational environment, including the clinical and other hands-on training provided by educational institutions.
3. The extent to which the internship is tied to the intern’s formal education program by integrated coursework or the receipt of academic credit.
4. The extent to which the internship accommodates the intern’s academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendar.
5. The extent to which the internship’s duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learning.
6. The extent to which the intern’s work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern.
7. The extent to which the intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any idea if my internship would be eligible for getting an SSN based on the following 7 points?

I'm currently on OPT and my H-1B was selected in the lottery. My company is in the process of filing the petition. However, there's a complication:

While I was on STEM OPT, the company legally changed its name. Despite this, I'm still receiving my pay stubs and W-2s under the *old* company name. The IRS also still shows the old name associated with my employment. But for the H-1B petition, they're using the *new* company name.

I'm worried about this inconsistency.  
Do I need to update the company name in SEVIS?  
Will this discrepancy affect my H-1B petition or cause issues with USCIS or future immigration processes?

I’m reaching out on behalf of my boyfriend, who graduated on May 3, 2025. His most recent I-20, issued in November 2024, listed his program end date as August 3, 2025, and his work authorization through May 16, 2025. At the time, he was expecting to take summer courses, but in late April, he was informed that he was no longer eligible to enroll. He was unaware that this changed his official program end date to May 3, as his I-20 was never updated to reflect the change.

Relying on the information in his existing I-20, he continued working until May 16. However, his DSO is now stating that he violated his F-1 status by working beyond his actual program end date. Since he was never issued a revised I-20, he had no reason to believe that his employment end date had changed.

He is currently consulting with immigration attorneys, but we’re concerned as his 60-day grace period ends on July 3. Has anyone encountered a similar situation? What would be the most effective way to move forward, given that this appears to be an unintentional violation caused by a lack of updated documentation?

We’re also wondering if there’s a reasonable chance that a reinstatement request via Form I-539 would be approved. For context, his SEVIS record has **not** been terminated yet.

Any advice, shared experiences, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;br/&gt;

I’m an F-1 visa holder on OPT (started Oct 2024) after graduating from Georgia Tech with a Master’s in Comp Science (Machine Learning). I returned to India on Dec 3, 2024, due to health issues and have been working remotely for Greenstand, a U.S.-based volunteer org. I recently got a contract MLE position at Verizon in Atlanta but am worried about re-entering the U.S. after being abroad for \~7 months.

Questions:

1. Will my 7-month absence affect my OPT status or re-entry chances?
2. Has anyone worked remotely from abroad on OPT and successfully re-entered? Any issues at the port of entry?
3. My F-1 visa is still valid, but what documents should I prepare for CBP (e.g., I-20, EAD, job offer)?
4. Should I expect issues if I need to renew my F-1 visa due to the long absence?
5. Any tips for explaining my health-related absence and remote work to CBP?

I don't want to spend more than a thousand dollars just to be sent back upon entering the US which seems like something that can happen because of the new government's policies.

&lt;li&gt;My F-1 visa is still valid, but what documents should I prepare for CBP (e.g., I-20, EAD, job offer)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I expect issues if I need to renew my F-1 visa due to the long absence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any tips for explaining my health-related absence and remote work to CBP?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to spend more than a thousand dollars just to be sent back upon entering the US which seems like something that can happen because of the new government&amp;#39;s policies.&lt;/p&gt;

I had my F1 visa interview today at the Delhi Consulate for a PhD program. My appointment was scheduled for 9:00 AM, and thankfully, it got approved. I’m writing this post to help future aspirants understand what to expect, how the process flows, and how to stay calm through it all.

**Timeline &amp; Process:**  
I reached the consulate early at 8:10 AM. There was already a small line forming outside, and we were gradually asked to queue based on time slots. Since I couldn’t carry any electronics or bags inside, I handed over my bag and phone to a juice shop nearby that charges around ₹300 and keeps belongings safe until you return.

Once inside, the first security check happens right after you enter the main consulate gate. Post that, there’s another security screening when entering the building itself. We were then directed to a waiting lounge, where all candidates waited for further instructions.

At around 8:40 AM, everyone with appointment times till 10 AM was called. We were again made to stand in line for biometrics verification. After that, I was allotted Counter 21 for my actual visa interview.

**The Interview:**  
The Visa Officer was an American, likely around 45–50 years old, very calm and welcoming.

**Me**: Good morning  
**VO**: Good morning! Please give me your passport and I-20.  
(I handed them over)

**VO**: Where are you going?  
**Me**: I’m going to \[City, State\] in the United States to pursue a PhD in abc at University XYZ.

**VO**: What other universities did you apply to?  
**Me**: I applied to three universities in the US and one in Japan. I received admission offers from two US universities and the one in Japan.

**VO**: Why did you choose this particular university?  
**Me**: The university offers excellent research opportunities with state-of-the-art labs and facilities in abc. The group I'll be joining has ongoing collaborations with leading institutions, and their current projects align really well with the kind of work I want to do. The research vision matches my long-term academic goals, and I believe this lab offers the best environment for me to grow as a scientist.

**VO**: Do you have any relatives or friends in the US?  
**Me**: I have some seniors from my field in the US - some are pursuing their MS, others are working. I’ve been in touch with one particular senior who lives near the university. He isn’t from my Indian institution but has been really helpful in giving me insights about the cost of living, budgeting, and what to expect from the environment there.

(The VO smiled, typed for around 20 seconds, then...)

**VO**: Enjoy your stay in the US. Your visa is approved. You’ll receive it within a week.  
(He returned my I-20 and kept the passport for stamping)

Key Takeaway:  
Confidence is the key. Know what you're doing, be clear about your research interests, and have a solid reason for choosing your university. Don't fake anything. Speak naturally and don’t overthink it.

If you're going for a PhD, remember that the officer is not there to grill you — they just want to be sure you know what you’re signing up for. Be calm, respectful, and focused. All the best to everyone preparing for their interview!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have TD Bank but I want to switch to a bank with no maintenance fees and no international transaction fees. It would be ideal if it also had a high interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your experience with this? Any bank recommendations? Thanks y&amp;#39;all.&lt;/p&gt;

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Should I just wait and see, or is it better to withdraw and reapply (though I’m not sure I have enough time left)? I also plan to write a letter of explanation and upload that too.

But would it be &lt;em&gt;realistically legal&lt;/em&gt; to take, say, a 7–10 day break, fly to a nearby country with cheap tickets (like Mexico City), stay there for 10 days, record and publish my content &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m there, then return to the U.S. and get paid for the work I did &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the U.S.? I have couple of freelance basis contractors that I work with, and they pay royalties. (Think of it as couple of udemies, but super niche)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course that I am likely to pursure is not an academic heavy course, and I do think that I will be able to play catch-up easily with the course-work. Bachelors in Media &amp;amp; Communication Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m currently on H1B and am accepted to a master program starting this fall. I was going to go home to get the student visa, however, since the scheduling is still on pause, I am contemplating doing a change of status.

1. Can I specify when to change to F1 status in the i539 form or I will automatically be changed to F1 as soon as the request is approved? 

2. If I don’t go home this summer, I do not anticipate to have time to go home throughout the next two school years. I plan to use the OPT &amp; STEM OPT extension before changing back to H1B (since my H1B is almost maxing out).

I’m an F-1 international student in the U.S., and I’m trying to confirm if my plan is allowed under immigration rules.

I just got a full-time internship offer for Fall 2025 (40 hrs/week), and I really want to do it. The issue is: I only have one course left to finish my degree.

Here’s the situation:
	•	I would do full-time CPT in Fall 2025
	•	I would not take any classes during Fall
	•	I’d then return and take my final course in Spring or Summer 2026
	•	My I-20 is valid until August 2026
	•	I would still graduate before the I-20 end date

But my school is saying I can’t delay graduation because of an internship. Their position is that if I only have one course left, I should graduate in Fall and not do full-time CPT.

I’ve heard of other students being able to do this — finishing internships and taking their last course later, especially if their I-20 is still valid. I’m not trying to delay graduation for no reason — I just want to get this valuable work experience and still finish on time.

Has anyone done something like this or gotten approval for it? Is there a specific SEVP or immigration rule that allows or prevents this?

My passport is expiring in early April 2026 and I need to have it renewed pretty soon, but am nervous about the mail-in renewal process taking too long and am hoping for advice on when I should renew.

I’m currently in the US under F1 status. I’ll be staying in the US until mid-August, then will be re-entering the US in mid-late September with OPT to start my job. I believe my passport needs to be valid for 6 months into the future to be readmitted under F1 status. Technically, my passport will be valid for a little over 6 more months at that point, but I’m nervous that the border officer is going to think I’m cutting it too close and deny entry.

I was planning to renew in the next week or so, but the other issue is that I absolutely need a valid passport by July 28—I’m taking the bar exam in the US and this is the only acceptable form of ID for me. I’m afraid that if I mail it in now, I won’t have my new passport in time for the bar exam, and I absolutely cannot have that happen.

Flights to JFK are cheaper than flying directly to Philadelphia (PHL), so I’m thinking about landing at JFK and having my sister pick me up and drive to Philadelphia.

I have two questions:

1. Is it okay to land at JFK even though my university is in Philadelphia?


2. Should I avoid mentioning my sister during immigration and instead book a hotel or pay a deposit for temporary student housing?



Has anyone been in a similar situation recently? Would love to hear your experience or advice.

Thanks!

Me: Good morning officer here you go.

VO: What other universities did you apply to

Me: I applied to 5 other universityes the are ...(named 4 and forgot the last one but didn't stay silent, told officer straight away that thats all I could remember.

VO: Why did you choose this university and program?

Me: Gerogia Tech's cybersecurity program is ranked among top 3 in the states for its cybersecurity program. It is one of the very few universities having a dedicated department for cybersecurity and privacy allowing me to work closely on my areas of interest.

I called in the office twice in December’24 and they said I am good to keep the money, plus got a mail about the notice of $1400 deposited too.

This is so stupid. Anyone knows if the money can be returned by online payment?


UPDATE:
I was able to resolve this — sharing the steps below. To recap, I received a Direct Deposit from the IRS for $1,400 in December, and a physical mail from the IRS this month asking for the money back.

Step 1: Call the IRS refunds department and let them know you received a mail asking you to return the money. Tell them you will return the payment from your bank, and ask the agent to please make a note on your account that the refunded money should be applied to the 2021 tax year.

Step 2: Call your bank and ask them to return or reverse the payment you received from the IRS. Make sure you locate the correct transaction of $1,400, and then ask them to process the request. They will almost certainly tell you this is a scam and that the IRS never asks for money back — explain that you’ve done your due diligence and wish to proceed. They will ask a bunch of questions for record-keeping purposes and then process the return.

AFAIK, this should be extremely safe since the money is going back to the source — the IRS. There is no way the IRS won’t acknowledge the returned funds. Worst case (in my mind) is that they apply it to the current tax year, but that's less likely since there will be a note on the account.

Also, this will be the full amount of $1,400. Do not worry about the interest shown on your transcript, and do not ask your bank to transfer extra — they cannot do it.

Make sure you have enough funds in your account, or the return will cause an overdraft.

Step 3: Wait for 3–4 business days and check your 2021 transcripts. You should see an update showing the money received, interest removed, and balance owed as zero.

IRS Phone Numbers: https://www.irs.gov/help/let-us-help-you (scroll down to numbers)

IRS call transcript to connect to an agent, here’s how the IRS call system (IVR) went:
What are you calling for?
➤ Incorrect Payment Issued

Are you calling to make a payment for a balance you owe?
➤ No

Account type?
➤ Individual

Callback prompt:
➤ System: “Rather than waiting, we can call you back when it is your turn. If you'd like a callback, press 1.”
➤ I pressed nothing — system repeated the prompt.
➤ Still pressed nothing.
➤ Went on hold and was eventually connected to a live agent.


Be patient — I had to wait 3 hours to reach an agent, who then transferred me to the refunds department (I chose the wrong IVR option), and it took another hour to get through.

If you do not have an account created with the IRS or do not wish to do the online part, you can skip it. Just make sure to call them about a week after returning the money to confirm that the update has been applied to your account.

If You Received a Physical Check:
1. If you cashed it – Follow the same steps as outlined above for direct deposit.

2. If you did not cash it – Call an IRS agent and ask if the check can be canceled from their end. If not, the safest option is to follow the instructions on the letter you received.

3. If your transcript shows you received a check — or if you’re unsure whether you got one (but you filed a 2021 tax return and your friends received theirs), either check your transcript or call the IRS and ask if they ever issued a check to you. If they did, explain your situation and ask what the next steps are.

➤ Incorrect Payment Issued&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you calling to make a payment for a balance you owe?
➤ No&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Account type?
➤ Individual&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callback prompt:
➤ System: “Rather than waiting, we can call you back when it is your turn. If you&amp;#39;d like a callback, press 1.”
➤ I pressed nothing — system repeated the prompt.
➤ Still pressed nothing.
➤ Went on hold and was eventually connected to a live agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be patient — I had to wait 3 hours to reach an agent, who then transferred me to the refunds department (I chose the wrong IVR option), and it took another hour to get through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not have an account created with the IRS or do not wish to do the online part, you can skip it. Just make sure to call them about a week after returning the money to confirm that the update has been applied to your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If You Received a Physical Check:
1. If you cashed it – Follow the same steps as outlined above for direct deposit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you did not cash it – Call an IRS agent and ask if the check can be canceled from their end. If not, the safest option is to follow the instructions on the letter you received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your transcript shows you received a check — or if you’re unsure whether you got one (but you filed a 2021 tax return and your friends received theirs), either check your transcript or call the IRS and ask if they ever issued a check to you. If they did, explain your situation and ask what the next steps are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Hi 

I’m starting a fully funded PhD program in the US this fall on an F1 visa. I have a personal trip planned to London for about a week in the first week of December, and I’m wondering about the process and feasibility of applying for a UK tourist visa from the US.

A few questions:

1. Can I apply for a UK Standard Visitor Visa from the US while I’m still in the early months of my F1 visa? Are there any risks or issues with re-entering the US on an F1 visa after such a short trip? (I’ll make sure to get my I-20 signed for travel.)


2. For those who’ve done this—how much financial proof do you need to show for a UK tourist visa? Would a $2,000 USD bank balance be enough for a 7-day trip if I’ve already booked flights and accommodation?


Would appreciate any insights or experiences. Thanks in advance!

Hi everyone,
I’m currently on an F1 visa with STEM-OPT that is set to expire in 2 months. I’ve already applied for a green card under the EB-5 category, and my I-485 application is currently pending.

Given the uncertainty of the green card process and the possibility that my I-485 could be denied or face issues, I’m exploring backup options to maintain my legal status in the U.S.

One option I’m considering is transferring to a new school and starting a new program that would allow me to work on CPT with I-20 from new school. However, I’m not sure if this is feasible at this stage, given my pending adjustment of status and nearing end of STEM-OPT.

My questions are:

1. Is it legally possible to transfer to another school and obtain CPT while my I-485 is pending?
2. Are there any risks or conflicts in doing so that could affect my pending green card application?
3. Has anyone here pursued a similar strategy successfully?Any guidance, insights, or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,

I just graduated with a B.S. in Biology from Shepherd University and I’m currently working part-time (20 hrs/week) in a neurobiology research lab at Marshall University under my 12-month post-completion OPT. The job pays $15/hr, which isn’t enough to cover rent, groceries, and bills, especially now that I’m transitioning into my master’s program at Marshall this fall.

My OPT is active and my work is directly related to my major. I’ve read the 20-hour minimum rule, but is it legally okay to add a second job (also related to biology or healthcare, like a lab tech or pharmacy tech role) as long as my total hours stay under 40/week and everything is reported in the SEVP portal?
	•	Have any of you worked multiple jobs under OPT without issues?
	•	Does USCIS or SEVP ever question the number of hours as long as the work is related?
	•	Any common red flags I should avoid (like shifts not clearly biology-related, or mislabeling work titles)?

I’m trying to make ~$1,000/week to stay financially afloat and willing to do any work that fits within the scope of my biology background and OPT rules.

Thanks in advance to anyone who’s navigated this!

* Students are being recruited with false promises of jobs and are then financially exploited.
* They are forced to pay a significant portion(40% - 55%) of their earnings to the company under various pretexts.
* Many students are coerced into faking their visa status to secure jobs, putting their futures at risk.

I’m an incoming F-1 student with a valid visa, and my university is located in Dayton, Ohio(it's Wright State University). However, I’m planning to fly into North Carolina first to stay with some family for a few days before heading to Ohio.

I just wanted to ask, will this raise any concerns with immigration at the port of entry? I’ve heard that officers sometimes ask why you're not flying directly to your university's state.

For context:

I’m entering the U.S. well before my program start date (more than 30 days in advance).

I have a clear travel plan from NC to Ohio. Also I have also booked my flight to Ohio from NC on August 12.

&lt;p&gt;VO : Have you been to the US before?&lt;br/&gt;
Me : Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO : What was the purpose of visiting?&lt;br/&gt;
Me : I wanted to visit my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO : Why X Univ?&lt;br/&gt;
Me : CS &amp;amp; Ling. is a rare combo for a major and it perfectly aligns with my areas of interests like AI/ML and NLP. Additionally, while X Univ. was checking all the boxes, the cost per credit was lower than my other admits which was the cherry on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO : What were your other admits?&lt;br/&gt;
Me : UMich, UCI, UCD for CS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO : Why X Univ. over them?&lt;br/&gt;
Me : Because my main goal is to do research in AI/ML and I can do that at X Univ. for a similar program but at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO : How will you fund your education?&lt;br/&gt;
Me : I have an education loan of X amount and my parents hold assets of X amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO : What do your parents do?&lt;br/&gt;
Me : *answers*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO : Congratulations, your visa has been approved.&lt;br/&gt;
Me : Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts :- Be confident and make sure you&amp;#39;re not mentioning employment opportunities. Prove that you have sufficient funds and do not give more info than asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

My issue with this is that it's kind of far, it would end up being like 12 hours of driving in a 3-day span.

My other option is to just do it at the airport on the 27th before I go. This is easier because I don't have to do a whole road trip, but it's also kind of last minute, so in case I have an issue with my documents, I won't have time to fix it.

Edit:  I have already applied and received my I-20 from my school and paid my SEVIS fee. But I don't get F-1 status until I actually go through border control. 

While my I-20 and paying the SEVIS fee are what I absolutely need to go to the US for F1, they may also check proof of ties to Canada, proof that I can pay for school, etc. I've done my best to have documents that prove these things, but that's obviously subject to the border control officer. In case the officer doesn't feel like these things are sufficient, if I were at a land crossing, I could get it fixed or get more documents before I go for real, but as I mentioned in my post, it's very inconvenient. 

My question is it worth it to be so cautious, or should it be fine either way?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so I&amp;#39;m not leaving for my master&amp;#39;s till June 27th so my parents wanted me to drive down to the nearest border crossing to get my F1 status.

In April 2025, I attended my F-1 visa interview at the Vancouver U.S Consulate. I am creating this host with the hope to give you my experience of applying for F-1 here in Canada.

My background in Canada is an International student in a Canadian high school. Btw, I am from China.

On the day of the interview, I dressed formally. I wore a white shirt, a pair of black dress pants, and dress shoes. I intended to make myself look more mature and genuine. The interview lasted about 4 mins, and only four questions were asked.

1. Why do you want to go to the university stated on your I-20?

I answered, because that university has one of the best engineering programs globally (my intended major is engineering), and it will also provide many research opportunities that I would not get from other universities.

2.What do your parents do?

I explained that my mother is retired and she used to be an engineer. My father is the manager of a department in his company.

3. How long have you been in Canada for as an international student?

I answered, 3.5 years.

4.Have you visited your university yet?

I answered, not yet, but I plan to visit there on \[a specific date\].

Then the visa officer said that my visa had been approved and would be mailed to the post office very soon.

I prepared a ton of documents (property ownership certificates in China, birth certificate, old passports, etc), but the officer only looked at my I-20, my passport, and the information on his computer (I guess it was my DS-160).

Remember: Bring your legal immigration document for your stay in Canada to the interview (like Canadian study permit and work permit). The consulate will check your immigration status in Canada before admitting you to the interview place.

I’m a Turkish citizen currently trying to renew my F-1 student visa. I qualify for the interview waiver program, and I’m trying to submit my application through the new US visa scheduling system (usvisascheduling.com).

When I follow the instructions (select Non-Immigrant Visa → Appointments to submit the interview waiver application), I get to the point where I need to select my visa category—but F-1 is not listed among the available options.

I’ve already contacted the U.S. Visa Service Desk twice. First they sent a generic reply about how the interview waiver works. Then they told me to “Close and Start Application” again, which I did, but nothing changed. I still can’t proceed because F-1 simply doesn’t show up.

Has anyone else from Turkey (or elsewhere) experienced this? Is this a system glitch, or are F-1 visa renewals currently paused too? Would really appreciate any insight.

I’m in a horrible situation. I was in my final semester of my Business Management degree, had thought to had made good progress and that I will graduate this summer 2025. 

At the end of Fall 2024, I requested for RCL since I only had 3 more classes ( 9 credits) left to finish my degree. My DSO looked at my request, approved my RCL roughly 10 days before semester end (Dec24).

Fast forward to the Spring 2025 semester, I was doing my 3 classes and started preparing for summer graduation and my OPT time that I was dearly waiting for. 

I applied for summer graduation March 20th, and then waited for a reply. During my in person class as well as online, I had asked my DSO as well as the F1 immigration compliance advisor about my graduation and OPT. They couldn’t tell me anything about the summer graduation but told me to fill out the OPT form. I took my time as a i was finishing my classes and my DSO had emailed me 2-3 days in a row telling me to submit my OPT request, which i found weird as she had never So i submitted it and immediately received email that it was denied and my DSO starting the email with “ While reviewing your academic record in SIS, I became aware that you failed the following courses after receiving authorization for RCL from NOVA for Spr 2025. You received authorized for RCL in Spr 2025 semester from NOVA based on the assumption that you were completing your degree plan requirements in the mentioned term.  Not satisfying your degree plan requirements makes you ineligible for graduation and consequently, ineligible to receive recommendation from NOVA for post-completion OPT. See attached a copy of your academic advising report.

 

On your email below, you mentioned that you will be graduating this summer 2025 term. 

 

Please explain how you plan to achieve this knowing that with your RCL approval, your I-20 expired on 05/12/2025 and (as per federal regulation) you cannot enroll for classes beyond the expiration date on your I-20 Form (see screenshot below):” 

After reading this email, I was obviously extremely shocked as I was not understanding how I would have possibly failed course last semester, and no one had noticed until the next semester after was finished. I understand checking grades is my responsibility , but once my DSO had approved the RCL and then I started the spring semester with only 3 classes instead of for. I cannot believe my school/ DSO could’ve not seen any warning notification that after my rcl was approved and i had 10 more days in the semester, i somehow magically had failed the class. They’re pointing out I didn’t inform them in time, when in reality i had no clue i had failed that class. 


Long story short,  my DSO has been the worst at explaining my F1 / I-20 / SEVIS situation, leaving the meeting i had requested and really needed, earlier. Only answering half of my questions in my emails afterwards and visibly being annoyed in her emails. 

Considering I was just about to graduate, and I do not wanna do a double degree spending any more $ on that school, what can i do? Did it all go correctly?

I’m currently in the U.S. on a J-2 visa as a dependent of a J-1 visa holder. I plan to return to my home country in about a month, and I would like to apply for an F-1 student visa after I return.

However, there’s a complication — my current visa is subject to the two-year home residency requirement (212(e)), and I’m worried that this might affect my chances of getting approved for an F-1 visa.

I’m not planning to change my status while in the U.S. — I will be applying for the F-1 visa directly from my home country, after I leave. I understand that the 212(e) rule mainly prevents people from adjusting their status inside the U.S. or applying for certain visas (like H-1B or a green card) before fulfilling the requirement or obtaining a waiver. But I’m still unsure if this rule could negatively impact my chances when applying for a student visa from abroad.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has professional experience with this, I’d be very grateful for your input.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice or insight on my situation.&lt;/p&gt;

I started my PhD at University A (top 30) with a fellowship, but things didn’t go as planned. The PI I was supposed to work with went on a 2-year sabbatical, and there were no other open labs in my area of interest. So I made the difficult choice to transfer to University B (top 50).

At B, I’ve continued my research, but I’ve run into two major problems:

 1. Persistent funding uncertainty, which affects both research continuity and support.

 2. My current PI is pushing me toward projects I’m not genuinely interested in they’re more mechanical engineering focused, while I’ve always been interested in something else and while hiring my PI said there’s opportunity for me.

Now, I’ve received a fully funded offer from University C (I applied at B and C at the same time, C got back to me at the end of Spring semester) where the research is exactly what I want to pursue long-term. I’m seriously considering transferring again — purely for academic alignment and stability.

But since this would be my second transfer, I’m worried it might raise red flags when it comes to:

 • Re-entry to the U.S.

 • Visa stamping or renewals

 • Scrutiny at CBP or consulate interviews

In my defense, i was on the left lane but I need to take a right. I was at intersection with red light. I turned on the indicator before it turned green so that the next lane guy would notice it and allow me to merge. 
After light turned green, i hoped he noticed it and took a quick glance and felt he slowly accelerating and tried to merge. But quickly realized he didnt noticed and he is little too near for the merge (later I realized it didnt even picked on my blind spot monitor he is that far away). So I retaliated a bit. (This might have looked ugly outside like am driving aggressively or something my wife as a passenger seat pitched in later). And then he looked like slowing down and I merged without any issues. 
I even waved at him in the inside the car in the rear window he can see. There was no horn too. 

But after i took the right, a police turned right and came in between our vehicles and turned on the lights. 

After that, he told me the why pulled over like I cut the car behind me when merging. 

I told him exactly what happened. And he asked if am a new driver seeing the sticker at the back of my car. I told him it’s almost a year now. 

He also asked if i have a good driving record. I told him yes and he asked for my DL. 

He took it and within like 90 seconds to 2 minutes he came back and gave me back the DL and told warning for this time. I told him thank you officer but he was already walking towards his vehicle. 

In normal circumstances, this might sound silly.

I completed my Master’s in CS in May 2024, and my initial OPT ends in the first week of July 2025. I’m now trying to apply for the STEM OPT extension.

Unfortunately, the company I was working with recently conducted mass layoffs with no prior warning, and my employment was terminated immediately. They had partially completed my STEM OPT paperwork but pulled back after the layoff, and they’re not open to reinstating or extending my employment.

I'm now looking for any leads on E-verified employers (startups, universities, or companies) who might be open to hiring someone on STEM OPT, even on a contract basis. The position must be paid and at least 20 hours per week, as per USCIS guidelines.

My background includes experience as a Research Assistant and Software Engineer. I've tried reaching out to consultancies, but many have asked me to misrepresent my profile or switch visa types, which I'm not comfortable with.

If you’ve faced something similar or know of any opportunities, I’d be incredibly grateful for your suggestions or referrals. I’m doing my best to stay within status and am feeling overwhelmed with the uncertainty.

1. Don't bullshit them - they don't need some romanticized answer on why you're doing a course/degree. 
2. Don't undersell the opportunities you will have in the USA - it's not logical to seem like you don't want to work there at all. 
3. Be extremely honest and to the point 
4. Maintain relaxed body language - don't stand with your body stiff and hands in your pocket. 
5. Lean forward on the counter if you are unable to hear the visa office.
6. Don't hesitate to ask them to repeat their question if you didn't hear/didn't understand it. 
It's better to answer correctly than to misunderstand and answer wrongly.
7. Don't focus on the person before/around you. If they are getting rejected it may scare you. Just focus on your breathing and yourself.

I checked USCIS website and it states that certain categories are automatically eligible for 180/540 days of extension if there application is submitted before the expiry date, this list of categories doesn’t consist of the category C03C which is for STEM OPT.

Is there any proof of this on any official US gov website that I can show to my employer?

I’m a Canadian citizen currently in the U.S. on an F-1 visa. I recently graduated and have applied for OPT. My EAD is still pending, but I expect it to be within the next few weeks.

In the meantime, I’ve been offered a part-time independent contractor role (remote). The company is based in California. I’m not planning to be on payroll or submit any invoices until I receive my EAD.

My questions:

1. Can I legally sign the independent contractor agreement now if I clearly state I won’t invoice or accept payment until my EAD arrives?

2. If I were to be paid through my Canadian corporation, does that change anything, or does it still count as unauthorized work since I’m physically in the U.S.?

3. Would working “unpaid” (but eventually invoicing retroactively once my EAD is issued) still be considered unauthorized employment?

Alternatively, should I ask them to hold off entirely until the EAD is in hand?

I’ve read conflicting things online, I just want to stay compliant with immigration rules while not holding up the company unnecessarily.

I'm hoping to get some clarity on a confusing situation as I prepare to return to the U.S. for the Fall 2025 semester. I've checked the official guidance on [travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html) and [ice.gov](https://www.ice.gov/sevis/i901), but there still seems to be a gray area—even my university’s international office is unsure.

# Context:

* I was previously enrolled at a U.S. university but had to take a **medical leave of absence for over 5 months**( left the states on december 13,2024 for a small vacation , but ended up breaking my skull 12 hours before my return flight 😬)
* I've now been **readmitted to the same school to finish my degree with just 6 credits left (but forced to take 9 to comply with the regulaltions)**, and they issued me a **new I-20 marked as “**CONTINUED ATTENDANCE - TRAVEL**” with a new SEVIS ID**.
* My **F-1 visa is still valid until May 2028**, but it has my **old SEVIS ID printed on it**.
* The **new I-20 lists my program end date as December 16, 2025**.

# My Questions:

1. **Do I need to get a new F-1 visa** because the SEVIS ID has changed, even though the visa itself is still valid and was issued for the same school and program?
2. The [State Department website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html) says:“Continuing students may enter the United States at any time before classes start.” Since I’m returning to the same school, **does this apply to me**, or does the new SEVIS ID mean I’m considered a *new* student and can only enter **within 30 days of the start date**?
3. **Will there be any issues at the port of entry** due to the mismatch between the SEVIS ID on my visa and the one on my I-20?
4. Since I’m returning on an “Initial” I-20, **how does this affect my OPT and CPT eligibility**? Do I need to complete **two full semesters** before I can apply? And if my program ends in December 2025, what are my options for **extending it** to qualify for practical training?

If anyone has gone through something similar or has definitive info, I’d really appreciate your input. This is one of those tricky edge cases and even my university’s international services team isn’t entirely certain.

I need some advice regarding my F1 visa process. Here's my situation:

I got admitted to University A and received the I-20 from them. I was preparing to go ahead with the visa process. However, I recently interviewed with University B, which is highly reputed and one of the top schools for my course.

Now, University B told me that I don't qualify through their standard admission process, but they're considering me under a Dean’s Special Admission category. The catch is: the outcome will take anywhere from 10 to 45 days, which means I might only hear back by late July.

Here are my concerns:

University A's semester starts on August 25.

University B's semester starts in the first week of September.

I really want to attend University B, but I’m afraid waiting too long might risk my visa timeline.


My questions:

1. Should I wait to submit my DS-160 until I hear from University B?


2. Or should I go ahead and submit DS-160 using University A’s I-20 and schedule the visa interview?


3. If I go with University A and later get an admit from University B, is switching schools before or after visa stamping even possible?


4. Is it realistic to request late arrival if University B gives a late offer?



Any suggestions from people who’ve been in a similar situation would be hugely appreciated. I’m trying to make the smartest decision without jeopardizing my chances of attending my preferred university.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I wait to submit my DS-160 until I hear from University B?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or should I go ahead and submit DS-160 using University A’s I-20 and schedule the visa interview?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I go with University A and later get an admit from University B, is switching schools before or after visa stamping even possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it realistic to request late arrival if University B gives a late offer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions from people who’ve been in a similar situation would be hugely appreciated. I’m trying to make the smartest decision without jeopardizing my chances of attending my preferred university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m on F-1 OPT and just received my EAD card. My EAD start date is 6/2/2025. I already have a full-time job offer lined up, but the official start date is 9/3/2025.

That’s a 93-day gap, which I know exceeds the 90-day unemployment limit for post-completion OPT. I’m now trying to see if I can negotiate an earlier start date with my employer in the meantime.

But if the employer isn’t able to adjust the date, is it still possible for me to legally start working on 9/3 as long as I report the employment in SEVIS before then? Or would I already be out of status by Day 91?

Would really appreciate any advice or similar experiences, trying to make sure I stay compliant!

Thanks so much! 🙏

I'm an F-1 student on OPT, and I received my EAD card in March 2025, with an activation date of May 14. When I visited my local SSA office in San Francisco to apply for an SSN, they informed me that due to a ""new policy,"" I must wait 6 weeks after the EAD's start date before applying.

Previously, I was told to wait only 3 weeks. Now, the 6-week requirement seems arbitrary, and I haven't found any official documentation supporting this.

I've reviewed SSA's official guidelines, which suggest waiting 10 business days after the EAD becomes valid before applying for an SSN. There's no mention of a mandatory 6-week waiting period.

Has anyone else encountered this 6-week requirement? Is there an official SSA policy stating this, or is it a local office's internal guideline? Any insights or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

🔴VO : So what university are you going to study?

🔵Me : [State Name] State University. For a PhD. (I preempted from previous questions that his next question would be “Where else have you applied” since he was following that line of questioning with the students before me. However, since I hadn’t applied anywhere else I quickly followed up by mentioning the PhD)

🔴VO : Have you been to [State] before?

🔵Me : No. 

🔴VO : Have you been to [famous event] before ?

🔵Me : Since I haven’t been to [State], so no. But I am looking forward to it.

🔴VO : Where did you study before this? Did you do your Master’s in India?

🔴VO : (checks details, and keeps passport in a tray on the side). Okay. Your visa has been approved. 

🔵Me : Thank you so much! (skips happily out of the visa office).

I’m currently studying at a community college in the U.S. and I’ve completed two semesters so far. In each semester, I took only 4 classes. Right now, I’m enrolled in 2 summer classes, and I’ve already registered for 5 classes in Fall 2025 and 5 in Spring 2026 (which will be my last semester at community college).

The issue is: I’ll still have 2 more classes left to complete my associate degree. My plan was to extend my I-20 so I could finish those 2 classes in Fall 2026. After that, I plan to transfer to a university for my bachelor’s and finish the remaining 2 years.

Here’s where I’m confused and need help:
My visa expires on August 8, 2028, but based on the timeline, I’ll likely graduate from my bachelor’s program about 4 months after that (December 2028) 

Will this create any problems with my SEVIS status or OPT eligibility? I’m worried whether finishing my degree after my visa’s expiration would mean I’m out of status.

I read on the Department of Homeland Security website that visa expiration doesn’t determine your lawful stay in the U.S. – instead, it’s the I-94 duration that matters. My I-94 shows “D/S” (Duration of Status), which I understand means I can stay in the U.S. as long as I maintain my course of study.

Can someone please clarify this? Has anyone been in a similar situation or extended their I-20 like this? I really want to make sure I’m not jeopardizing my OPT eligibility or legal stay.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,

I submitted my post-completion OPT application on June 2, and I just received a job offer. The tricky part is—they originally wanted me to start in June, but I had to remind them I’m still finishing up school and can’t legally begin until after that. So now, my start date is set for July 14 on paper, which is already a stretch.

I’m really anxious about whether my OPT and EAD will be approved in time. I’m seriously considering premium processing, even though the cost is steep.

Before I move forward, I wanted to ask:
	1.	Has anyone successfully sped up their OPT approval without premium processing—for example, by uploading a job offer letter or calling USCIS?
	2.	If you’ve done premium processing, how fast did your case get approved?
	3.	Any advice for dealing with tight timelines between OPT filing and job start dates?

Just wanted to share my F1 visa interview experience which took place today at the US Embassy in New Delhi. My appointment was at 8:50 AM, and I reached the embassy around 8:10 AM. There was already a long queue outside, and they were allowing entry only for applicants with interview slots before 10 AM.

After a security check, we were seated inside in rows. I had to wait there for about 30 minutes. Then came the biometrics, which took another 10 minutes due to the line.

Finally, I was sent to the actual interview line. I was assigned **counter number 12**. Before me, three people (all F1 applicants) had their interviews, and all were unfortunately rejected. Here’s what happened:

1. **First guy** was from a Computer Science background. The VO asked him, “Do you know any computer language?” and he said **“No.”** That was probably the biggest red flag, given his degree.
2. **Second guy** was over-explaining his finances. He mentioned things like **“My father has 1 crore in savings, 5 crores in FDs, and I also have a 140k education loan.”** It was too much, too fast, and possibly unnecessary.
3. **The girl** was asked, “Why this university?” She only talked about the city, saying it’s beautiful and has good weather, but didn’t mention **anything** about the university or her course.

Watching all this back-to-back really made me nervous. I genuinely felt like I might get rejected too.

The visa officer at my counter looked like an **Indian-American**. He was calm, polite, and spoke both English and Hindi fluently. He was also speaking in Hindi to some elderly visitors before me, so that helped ease my nerves a little.

When my turn came:

* He greeted me with a smile and asked for my **passport** and **I-20**.
* Then he asked, **“What’s your educational background?”** I explained that I had done my **BSc and MSc in Mathematics**.
* Next, he asked, **“What will you do in your PhD?”** I had a prepared answer, but in that moment I fumbled a bit. Still, I gave an honest explanation of my research interests in simple language.
* Lastly, he asked, **“Who will fund your education?”** I said, **“The university itself is funding me. It’s a fully funded PhD program.”**

Then came the golden words:  
**“Your visa has been approved. Enjoy your stay in the United States.”**

I thanked him, took my I-20 back, and left. He kept my passport for stamping. That moment of relief — after watching four rejections — was honestly indescribable.

Tips:

* Be honest.
* Don’t over-explain.
* Know your academic background and program well.
* Avoid unnecessary financial bragging.

This on site manager however retired, and was replaced by a new manager, information which I updated on my SEVP account and let my DSO know. 

My question is the following now. Should I also update the manager information on the I-983 form? I asked my DSO twice about it, and I never got a response back on the matter (as this happened after I received my EAD card, and there was no place to upload an updated copy of the form). Furthermore, my pay got a small raise, hence the hourly pay I had on my original document has changed. Should I also update this information (section 3), and ask the director who signed it before to re-sign it? Would it look weird that one section in the form has a completely different date compared to the original pages of the form?

However, I’m worried that the U.S. college might not accept all of my credits—or worse, might not accept any of them at all.

My other option would be to stay in Honduras to finish my degree (probably by Q1 2027) but then what?

* I have a valid F1 visa stamp
* I’m a full-time student
* My I-20 is up to date and signed for travel
* No recent change of status or OPT/CPT situation

Stood outside for about 5 mins, they scanned and patted me and scanned the passport and let me in.

Here there was another line before going inside the building and after 2-3 mins I was let in.

Again, another scan and pat and was sent in another section of the building, where there was another line.

In about 5 mins they checked my passport again and asked me to sit on the chairs, they have washrooms and drinking water and dustbins here, in case you happen to be carrying an empty pack of Doritos like me.

Here had a wait of about 5 mins and then sent to go inside another building where they take the interviews.

Again, one more line and wait of about 10 mins and they matched my biometrics to the VAC biometrics and asked me to join another line.

At the end of this line you get assigned to one of the counters, and 2-3 people were there at my counter.

I was given the 3rd counter from the wall, and it was very nice, polite and soft-spoken white guy, maybe early to mid 30s and looked younger than his age.

I went to his counter, and he asked for my passport, I nervously slipped my i-20 and SEVIS along with the passport because they had called out in the line before to have them ready.

I tried to take them back, but he said it's okay, he never looked at them.

He asked me the following questions:

* my educational and professional background
* why I wanted to study now if I have a good job
* how I was going to fund it

Me: I pass the i20

VO: Which university are you going to?

Me: University of Southern California.

VO: reads my i20 I see you’re going for Computer Science.

Me: Yes.

VO: Which other universities did you apply to?

Me: I had applied to 5 other universities. named all of them

VO: How are you going to be financing it?

Me: I’ve taken an education loan of this much from this bank which will cover my tuition and living expenses for the 2 years I’ll be there.

VO: What does your father do?

Me: He’s a retired employee.

VO: What was he doing before his retirement?

Me: answered that

VO: Do you have work experience?

Me: Yes, I do have work experience.

VO: Where did you work at?

Me: Deloitte.

VO: intense typing Your visa is approved. Thank you!

Me: Thank you! Have a good day.

VO: You too!

It was pretty chill, so I guess if you’re confident about yourself and you know what you’re talking about, you should absolutely be fine. And a trend I’ve definitely seen is that they really don’t ask much if it’s a good university (not always true or a fact but that’s what I’ve noticed from my experience). I was actually really scared since I come from an aerospace background and transitioning to CS. So they didn’t ask much about that to me and I had thoroughly prepared for it haha. It was also scary because the VO had rejected like 4-5 people straight in front of me.

&lt;p&gt;Me: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: Which other universities did you apply to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I had applied to 5 other universities. named all of them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: How are you going to be financing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I’ve taken an education loan of this much from this bank which will cover my tuition and living expenses for the 2 years I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: What does your father do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: He’s a retired employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: What was he doing before his retirement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: answered that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: Do you have work experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Yes, I do have work experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: Where did you work at?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Thank you! Have a good day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: You too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty chill, so I guess if you’re confident about yourself and you know what you’re talking about, you should absolutely be fine. And a trend I’ve definitely seen is that they really don’t ask much if it’s a good university (not always true or a fact but that’s what I’ve noticed from my experience). I was actually really scared since I come from an aerospace background and transitioning to CS. So they didn’t ask much about that to me and I had thoroughly prepared for it haha. It was also scary because the VO had rejected like 4-5 people straight in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just stay confident, you guys will get through!&lt;/p&gt;

In time: 9:00 AM

Out time: 11:10 AM

While standing in line, I noticed the officer at Counter 14 was asking almost everyone about how they were funding their education or trip. I was really hoping to get that counter—and I did. Luckily, I had reviewed my tuition and funding details thoroughly.

I also kept my old passports in my hand (visible for them to see) because that's what people had suggested me.

Here’s how the conversation went:

VO: Hello, how are you?

Me: (Before I could fully respond, she asked for my passport and I-20)

I'm doing good, thank you for asking. (while handing over documents)

VO: So you're going to (university name)?

Me: Yes.

VO: What program?

Me: I'm going for (program name).

VO: Why did you choose (university name)?

(I don't remember if she said ""why did you choose this university"" or ""why did you apply to this university"")

Me: I chose this university primarily because of its 2-year program.

(I realized this wasn’t the best answer—it just came out suddenly and wasn’t what I had planned to say.)

VO: (interrupts) But all master’s programs are for 2 years.

Me: Other universities I had applied to were offering 9-month programs.

VO: Why do you want to do a 2-year program?

Me: I’m from a non-business background, and having 2 years will give me more time to understand the subjects and concepts (this is not how I said it exactly but it was something along these lines)

VO: Alright, what background are you from?

Me: I’ve done my undergrad in (major name), and I plan to use that in the business world.

VO: (interrupts) How are you going to fund your education?

Me: I’ve secured a loan of $82k. I’ve also received a $42k scholarship. (She interrupted before I could mention a TA opportunity)

VO: What does your father do?

Me: He works as a (designation) at (company name).

VO: What’s his salary?

Me: He earns (amount in $). He’s also willing to help me with $20k–$30k if needed.

VO: (hands back my I-20) Thank you, your visa has been approved. Have a great day ahead!

Me: Thank you so much! (I couldn’t say anything more because I was having difficulty in picking up my old passports)

**Random info that may be helpful:**

You can carry a small sling bag, tote, or paper bag with your water bottle and documents. I didn’t know this and struggled a bit so I eventually had to throw away my disposable bottle.

I carried my phone with me. There’s a small stall (the water bottle stall) near the embassy that charged ₹100 and kept my phone safely while I was inside.

I would prefer that you carry ALL important and relevant original documents like academic records, birth certificate, etc. A VO on another counter asked for a birth certificate (for a tourist visa I think).

There is a washroom inside &amp; a place to fill drinking water as well. There is a vending machine &amp; a Baskin Robbins ice cream fridge.

Spanish citizen here on a J-1 research scholar visa. I need some input about an upcoming trip.

**My situation:**

* J-1 program ends: February 2026 (per DS-2019)
* Spanish passport expires: mid December 2025
* Traveling outside US: June 2025
* When I re-enter, passport will have 5 months 28 days validity

**What I know:**

* Spain is exempt from the 6-month passport rule
* I was admitted with D/S when I first entered (passport didn't cover full program then either)
* Already have appointment to renew passport in Spain in July

**My questions:**

1. Any issues re-entering with &lt;6 months passport validity?
2. Will the airline let me board the return flight?
3. Since I got D/S before, will I get it again or could they limit my stay to passport expiration?

I know I should have renewed earlier, but the consulate appointments are impossible to get. Planning to tell CBP about my July renewal appointment if asked.

Interview Conversation

Me: Good morning, officer.
VO: Good morning. How are you doing?
Me: Doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?
VO: Doing good as well.
(I handed over my I-20 and passport without her asking.)
VO: Thank you for passing the documents. I see you’re going to IU.
Me: Yes, officer.
VO: Why IU?
Me: The primary reason is that I’ve received a $55K/year scholarship. Another reason is that while most MBA programs have a similar core curriculum, what really stood out to me about Kelley is the kind of experience it offers outside the classroom…

VO: Have you seen the movie Hoosiers?
Me: No, officer, but I’ve heard that’s the name of their basketball team.

I applied for my STEM OPT extension and had a quick question regarding employer name consistency.

On both my **I-983** and **STEM OPT I-20**, the employer name is listed as **“ABC Company”**. However, in the **E-Verify system**, the company is registered simply as **“ABC”**, without “Company”. So when I filled out the **I-765**, I entered **“ABC”** as the employer name to match what’s in E-Verify.

Everything else matches. I’ve also filed under **premium processing**.

Has anyone been in a similar situation where there’s a small variation in the employer name across documents? Could this potentially be an issue with USCIS? Would love to hear any experiences or advice!

I’m currently in the STEM OPT extension process and have a couple of questions I hope someone can help with.

I’ve been working at Company A during my first year of OPT and filed my STEM extension with them. My I-983 and other documents were submitted, and I’m now in the waiting period with the 180-day automatic extension in place.

But I just received a job offer from Company B and would really like to switch. My question is:  
**Can I change employers while my STEM OPT application is pending?**  
If I submit a new I-983 and notify my DSO, can I start working for Company B right away? Or do I **have to wait until I actually receive my STEM EAD card**?

Also, has anyone here applied for **premium processing** while their STEM OPT case was pending? If yes,  
**Can I still apply for premium now to speed it up and hopefully switch jobs and start working at the new company within a month?**

And for those of you who recently received your STEM OPT EAD — how long did it take from submission to approval?

Any insight is appreciated and the post is to get some insight and reassurance. I started my OPT job at a medical scribe company which was weird with hours. They hired me so I had a start date but only paid me for trainings &amp; probationary period first before they could place me into a department where I’d work 20 hours/week. 
For training I was paid for 16 hours only. This was before I hit my 90 day mark. At my day 80 I switched jobs and got employed full time to a proper place because this seemed risky. 

How should a situation like this be handled for SEVP stuff? A job that hires you, gives you a start date but doesn’t pay you 20 hours/week. I left this place before my 90 days period so I believe this should still be fine because breaching the 90 days would’ve been bad. But that did not happen. 


Any insight is appreciated. I’ve also reached out to DSO.

I’m an F-1 student with an approved CPT I-20 in hand, starting June 9th. My employer wants me to start onboarding earlier, so I asked my ISO to see if they could move up the start date. But the ISO has been very slow, and I’m worried they might only finalize a new CPT start date (like June 2nd) *after* I’ve already started on June 9th (for example, they finalize it on June 11th).

I know working before the approved start date is a violation, but I’m following the June 9th date on my current I-20. My fear is that if they backdate my CPT start date in SEVIS after I start, it’ll look like I worked without authorization for those few days (June 9th–10th) because the system only updates on June 11th.

I’ve emailed my ISO about this multiple times but they’re not replying, and I’m really stressed.

My fear is that if they backdate my CPT start date in SEVIS after I start, it’ll look like I worked without authorization for those few days (June 9th–10th) because the system only updates on June 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve emailed my ISO about this multiple times but they’re not replying, and I’m really stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has anyone been in this situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did it cause issues for OPT or later visa applications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any advice for dealing with ISO admin errors like this?&lt;/li&gt;

To show my uncle’s support during the interview, I’m planning to carry his last 6 months’ bank statements. He’s a retired professional, so I may not be able to provide his ITRs.

What other documents should I bring to show his financial support? Would an affidavit of support or any other proof help?

Two quick questions:

My F-1 visa is valid until Nov 2026, but STEM OPT (if approved) would run through June 2027. Will the visa expiry affect my STEM OPT approval?

🎤 Interview Transcript

VO: Hello, good morning.
Me: Hello.

VO: Pass me your passport.
(Note: The staff had informed us to submit the passport, SEVIS receipt, and I-20, so I handed over all three. VO only needed the passport, but accepted everything without issue.)

(He began typing into his computer for a few seconds.)

VO: Why the USA?
Me: I’m going for an MS in Human-Computer Interaction (at indiana university bloomington). During my research, I found that 7 out of the top 10 universities offering strong programs in HCI are in the USA. That made it a clear choice for me.

VO (looking at my DS-160): So, you work as a UX designer? You mentioned your track being human interaction?
Me: I work as a UX designer. My course is in Human-Computer Interaction. HCI practitioners are often UX designers — we work on building experiences for digital products.

VO: How are you funding your education?
Me: I have an education loan of $X and bank savings of $X.

VO: Your visa is approved. Thank you.
Me: Thank you!


---

💡 Additional Tips

Only submit documents when asked — I initially handed over SEVIS and I-20 along with my passport due to the staff's instructions. The VO didn’t mind, but it’s always best to wait for a request.

Stay confident and clear in your responses. I had to correct the VO about my course and job — I did it politely, and it went smoothly.

My entire interview lasted only about 25 to 30 seconds, which genuinely surprised me. It was so quick and to the point!

I saw a lot of people getting rejected or receiving white slips around me, which made me a bit anxious. I even started lightly jumping in place from nervous energy — but everything turned out fine in the end.

Be concise and honest when explaining your funding.

Most importantly, don’t overthink it — sometimes the interviews are much quicker and smoother than you expect.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;🇺🇸 F1 Visa Interview Experience – Approved!&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone,

I have my F1 visa interview coming up next week, and I’d really appreciate some help in preparing for a few expected questions. I’m a 31-year-old with an M.Tech in Civil Engineering and ~9 years of experience in the core civil engineering domain, primarily working on large scale infrastructure projects in India.

Some questions that I expect to come up are:
	1.	Why pursue an MBA in the USA and not in India?
	2.	Why do an MBA after already completing a master’s (M.Tech)?
	3.	Why MBA after 8 years of work experience?
	4.	What are your post MBA plans?
      5.  Why not Executive MBA? Why FTMBA?
       6. How are you funding the studies?

My goal post MBA is to transition into leadership roles in infrastructure development/consulting and bridge the gap I’ve experienced in core civil project management till now. 

Having gone through a lot of posts in this forum, I understand that each case is different and much would depend on the VO and me during the interview itself. However, I am looking for some help with the above queries as to how can I frame answers to them without sounding too rehearsed or coming across as unprepared. I am concerned with the above queries (like for example: how well to justify why I am doing MBA after all these years).

I would appreciate any help on the above and feel free to comment on how should i approach any other questions that might come up. Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I had my interview in the consulate in Vancouver for a J-1 visa for a summer internship. This is my third US visa. My first was a J-1 that went under AP for 3 weeks before approval. Second is B1/B2 that was verbally approved on site in Vancouver a few months ago. The current one is my third. The office decided that I had to undergo AP which has been ongoing since April 23, 2025.

During the interview, she offered me the choice to whether leave my passport at the consulate or just keep it with me until the AP is concluded and decided to keep it since I was not sure about how things would go moving forward from this point on.

was this a bad decision on my part to keep my passport? Would’ve the AP been concluded faster if I had left it with the officer?

I will be travelling to Maryland with the said family friend by car after a few days. Can I do that? Will I have any problem at the immigration, since I am landing in JFK instead of Washington DC(which is close to my uni)?&lt;/p&gt;

Documents asked: Passport and I-20

Interview:

ME: Good Morning

VO: Morning is good indeed!  What’s the purpose of applying?
 
ME: I would be going for my masters at Carnegie Mellon University, and my course of study is Masters of Information Systems Management with concentration in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics

VO: (her facial expressions told me that the name of the course was too long and I should have told the short form instead maybe) So why CMU?

ME: I chose Carnegie Mellon University’s MISM-BIDA program because it offers a perfect blend of technical depth and business acumen, which aligns directly with my career aspirations in data analytics. Moreover CMU has a great reputation in both analytics and computer science programs.

VO: Oh is it? Never heard of it. (she is kidding right?)

ME: Yes it is ranked.. (interrupts me)

VO: So how will you be funding yourself?

ME: The expenses for the complete duration of the program would be funded by my parents through their bank savings and term deposits in addition to my mother’s annual salary. She works for Google India.

VO: Google, that I have heard. So going for masters directly after bachelors?

ME: Yes I believe going for masters directly after my undergrad would help me deepen my analytical skills without losing momentum

VO: (with a smile) Well I am afraid that I'll have to keep your passport for that (took me a second to realize what she said. Dude, why would you start a sentence like that???)

ME: Sorry?

VO: your visa is approved and you will get it after 7 days.

ME: thank you and have a great day!!

I’m currently trying to renew my F-1 visa and ran into something odd during the application process.

Based on current U.S. State Department guidelines, F-1 visa renewals **should** qualify for an interview waiver if you meet certain conditions (same visa category, no refusals, within 12 months etc.). I meet all the requirements. But when I got to the “Interview Waiver” section of the application, it just says:

""This Visa Category does not support Interview Waivers.""

No waiver eligibility questions came up either. I was able to access the questions yesterday, and I am wondering if this is a glitch or impacted by recent news. To my knowledge, there haven’t been any recent changes in policy or announcements removing F-1 from the waiver list. Just wondering if anyone else has seen this recently? Is this a glitch in the system, or are certain embassies not supporting waivers right now?

Any insight or recent experiences would be super helpful. Thanks!

Country: Nepal

Visa Type: F1

P.S I found that this might be country dependent as some of my international friends did not have same issue

I’m currently facing a significant dilemma in my career journey. As an international student in my final semester of the Master of Public Health program, which is STEM-designated, I’m eligible for up to three years of OPT (Optional Practical Training). I recently applied for my OPT in May, and I’ve been actively applying for jobs. Despite securing several interviews, I haven’t been able to land a job yet, and it’s becoming increasingly stressful.

To complicate things, someone suggested that I consider applying for an accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program at my school. The program would last for two years and could potentially open up more stable job opportunities in healthcare. However, if I decide to enroll in this nursing program, I would have to forfeit my OPT, which is a difficult decision because my OPT gives me a chance to gain work experience and stay in the U.S. temporarily.

At the core of my dilemma is the question of what path will ultimately help me secure a green card and establish a long-term future here. I’m torn between continuing to look for a job that aligns with my public health background hoping that something comes through soon or pivoting to nursing, which might provide a clearer path to permanent residency. Additionally, I’m considering whether I could utilize my OPT to gain work experience and then apply to a PhD program, which would allow me to continue my education and strengthen my qualifications.

I’d really appreciate any thoughts, advice, or ideas from those who have faced similar choices or have insights into navigating this process.

I have always wanted to apply and get accepted in top universities there. But the requirements those universities seek is not something my school here offers.

I applied stem extension before a month through my previous employer. Case still pending.

I ended employment with previous employer and now found new employment before EAD expiry. New employer signed I 983 and also got new i20.

Should I file a new I765 application or just upload latest evidences (new i20, e verify report, cover letter)to Unsolicited evidence section.? 

Also what documents should I upload to unsolicited evidence?

Is premium processing advisable?

Any guidance will be greatly appreciated.

I’m an international student at Arizona State University majoring in Applied Business and Technology Solutions, with a certificate in Applied Business Data Analytics. I have about 56 credits left until graduation.

Lately, I’ve been considering switching my major to Supply Chain Management because: •	It’s one of the top programs at ASU. •	It’s a STEM major, which would make me eligible for 3 years of OPT instead of just 1. •	It seems more specific and better recognized compared to my current major, which feels a bit too broad and non-technical.

However, if I switch, I’ll have to take about 70 credits to graduate, including some tough math and computer courses. That means an extra semester or more, and a heavier academic load.

I’m stuck between: •	Finishing faster with my current non-STEM major (1 year OPT), or •	Switching to a top STEM major (3 years OPT but more time, money, and effort).

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s faced a similar decision or has advice. Is it worth the extra effort for the longer OPT and more recognized major?

Last year, I married my partner, who is a U.S. citizen. Unfortunately, due to financial hardship, I was unable to continue my studies and fell out of status. We also could not afford an immigration attorney at the time, which delayed our ability to take the proper steps. As a result, I have been out of status for approximately seven months and am currently considered undocumented.
Thankfully, I now have the financial means to begin the adjustment of status process. However, I am deeply anxious about proceeding, especially given the current political climate surrounding immigration. I personally know two individuals in similar situations who were detained by ICE after their interviews and held in immigration detention centers while awaiting court dates. This has made me extremely fearful about initiating my case.
I have spoken with an attorney who suggested that I might consider “voluntarily” leaving the U.S. and applying for a green card through marriage from my home country. However, I understand that leaving under these circumstances could trigger a 3- or 10-year reentry ban, depending on how my overstay is interpreted. That possibility is terrifying, especially since my husband is from the U.S. and we ultimately plan to build our life here.
Neither I nor my husband have any criminal record. We don’t have family support here—my husband’s family is not actively involved in our lives—and while I do have a good life back in my home country, we are deeply concerned about the risk of detention or deportation if I move forward with the adjustment process inside the U.S.
I would truly appreciate any advice or guidance. I feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. We just want to do everything the right way, but I’m so afraid of making a mistake that could separate us permanently.

i have now paid it and printed the receipt but the mail i received says the consulate will be able to verify the payment within two business days after the payment completion date (today is a sunday and tomorrow is Monday, my interview is at 10 am, there’s barely any time and idk if they will be able to verify my payment) 

but when i login to the i-901 page it does the the status as “paid”

I am an F-1 student and I was granted off-campus work authorization under Special Student Relief (SSR) due to the situation back home. I have been working off-campus with an EAD issued under SSR.

I am now planning to travel outside the U.S. and return, and I will need to renew my F-1 visa while abroad.

1. Were you able to renew your visa without issues after working on SSR-based EAD?

2. Did you qualify for the interview waiver, or were you called for an in-person interview?

3. If interviewed, what kind of questions were you asked regarding your off-campus employment?

4. Did you disclose your SSR EAD and off-campus job in your DS-160 or visa application documents?

5. Did any of you face delays, denials, or extra scrutiny at the consulate or port of entry?

# Interview Transcript:
**VO:** (In Spanish) Good morning (:
**Me:** (In Spanish) Good morning (: 
**VO:** (In Spanish) Please pass your documents.
(*Scans DS-160*)  
(*Looks at her screen*)  
**VO:** (In Spanish) Do you speak English too? 
**Me:** (In Spanish) Yes
**VO:** What are you studying in the United States?  
**Me:** A PhD in Material Science and Engineering 
(*Looks at her screen*)
**VO:** Who is paying for your education? 
**Me:** The university is paying for my studies 
(*Looks at my I-20*)
**VO:** And will you be living in the university too?  
**Me:** Yes, I received an invitation to a program and I'll live on grad housing.   
(*VO checks her screen for 10 seconds and nods*)  
**VO:** (In Spanish) Your visa is approved. You’ll need to carry this document (points at I-20) when you travel. Have a nice day
**Me:** (In Spanish) Thank you, you too (: 
**VO:** (Looks at her screen and smiles)

The VO was warm, she noticed I was nervous but she was pacient with me and helped me ease the nerves, I think that's why she decided to speak in Spanish at the end.

&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; (In Spanish) Yes
&lt;strong&gt;VO:&lt;/strong&gt; What are you studying in the United States?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; A PhD in Material Science and Engineering 
(&lt;em&gt;Looks at her screen&lt;/em&gt;)
&lt;strong&gt;VO:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is paying for your education? 
&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; The university is paying for my studies

&lt;strong&gt;VO:&lt;/strong&gt; And will you be living in the university too?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I received an invitation to a program and I&amp;#39;ll live on grad housing.&lt;br/&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;VO checks her screen for 10 seconds and nods&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;VO:&lt;/strong&gt; (In Spanish) Your visa is approved. You’ll need to carry this document (points at I-20) when you travel. Have a nice day

Hi all,
Last August (2024), I traveled to Canada, but my return flight to the U.S. got canceled and I ended up returning 4 days later than planned. Because of that, my I-94 now has incorrect port of entry info — either a missing entry or the wrong port name.

I already submitted my **OPT EAD application** using this I-94 without realizing the issue. Now I’m worried —
**Should I get the I-94 corrected now?**
Will doing that affect my **EAD application that's already in process**?

I really can’t afford to apply for EAD again (timeline or cost-wise). My OPT starts July 1, 2025.

Would appreciate any guidance on what’s safer:

* Fix I-94 now
  **OR**
* Wait for EAD card to arrive, then fix it?

I reached the venue at 7:50 AM and they had already started sending in people for the 9 AM slot. So, I asked the officer checking the passport and he let me cut the line since my slot was earlier.   
Got in, cleared all the security procedures and went to join the line. It was not crowded for that time and I waited in line for around 20 mins before we moved to another waiting line. Waited for another 20 mins on the line there.

Then we were led to the spots leading to the VO. Each line leading to the VO will have 3 people. One who is being interviewed while the other 2 stand at a distance.

I was chill all the way leading up to the VO watching animals on TV (Yes the consulate has videos of wild animals on TV). As soon as i joined the line leading to the VO, my heartrate skyrocketed partly because of all the noise from all the counters with VO officers asking questions across the mic simultaneously. I tried to stay calm and achieved it slightly.

My interview went this way:

VO: Good morning, can I see your documents please?  
Me: Good morning, officer! (passes the documents)  
VO: Going to XXX University is it? (reads from my i20)  
Me: Yes I'm going to XXX, YYY campus  
VO: What are you gonna study (pointing to my i20) its a bit vague here.  
(My i20 has Engineering/Industrial Management and i had filled out Engineering Management in my DS160 as I'm going for MSEM)  
Me: cleared his question yada yada  
VO: When did you graduate?  
Me: I graduated earlier this May officer (and told him the specifics of my bachelors with grades (i graduated first class with distinction))  
VO: Can you tell me a bit about the program you are going to study  
Me: yada yada yada  
VO: What other universities did you apply to ?  
Me: I applied to 4 and got into 3. 2 of them have an acceptance rate of below 10%  
VO: Thats good, why XXX uni?  
Me: yada yada   
VO (interrupts): I see you have a scholarship too (from my i20 funding)  
Me: Yes, I have a 20% merit scholarship from XXX on my tuition  
VO: Place you right hand fours fingers on the scanner. What is the slogan of XXX?  
Me: It's ""Go XYZ!""  
VO: Go XYZ! (Hands back my i20) Take this with you when you go to the US! Have a nice day!

Status: Approved!

I was sooo dazed with what happened that I just thanked him and left as fast as i could and left my SEVIS Fee receipt on the counter.  
I was called back to take it. I apologized but the VO was sweet and just smiled it away.

So guys stay confident (even if you are not and especially if you are not) becasue no one else is gonna know. Speak confidently and always offer more information (not proof like look at this paper i have as proof of funding etc)  
The VO will take what they need and move on to the next question.

As soon as i joined the line leading to the VO, my heartrate skyrocketed partly because of all the noise from all the counters with VO officers asking questions across the mic simultaneously. I tried to stay calm and achieved it slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interview went this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: Good morning, can I see your documents please?&lt;br/&gt;
Me: Good morning, officer! (passes the documents)&lt;br/&gt;
VO: Going to XXX University is it? (reads from my i20)&lt;br/&gt;
Me: Yes I&amp;#39;m going to XXX, YYY campus&lt;br/&gt;
VO: What are you gonna study (pointing to my i20) its a bit vague here.&lt;br/&gt;
(My i20 has Engineering/Industrial Management and i had filled out Engineering Management in my DS160 as I&amp;#39;m going for MSEM)&lt;br/&gt;
Me: cleared his question yada yada&lt;br/&gt;
VO: When did you graduate?&lt;br/&gt;
Me: I graduated earlier this May officer (and told him the specifics of my bachelors with grades (i graduated first class with distinction))&lt;br/&gt;
VO: Can you tell me a bit about the program you are going to study&lt;br/&gt;
Me: yada yada yada&lt;br/&gt;
VO: What other universities did you apply to ?&lt;br/&gt;
Me: I applied to 4 and got into 3. 2 of them have an acceptance rate of below 10%&lt;br/&gt;
VO: Thats good, why XXX uni?&lt;br/&gt;
Me: yada yada&lt;br/&gt;
VO (interrupts): I see you have a scholarship too (from my i20 funding)&lt;br/&gt;
Me: Yes, I have a 20% merit scholarship from XXX on my tuition&lt;br/&gt;
VO: Place you right hand fours fingers on the scanner. What is the slogan of XXX?&lt;br/&gt;
Me: It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Go XYZ!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
VO: Go XYZ! (Hands back my i20) Take this with you when you go to the US! Have a nice day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Status: Approved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sooo dazed with what happened that I just thanked him and left as fast as i could and left my SEVIS Fee receipt on the counter.&lt;br/&gt;
I was called back to take it. I apologized but the VO was sweet and just smiled it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So guys stay confident (even if you are not and especially if you are not) becasue no one else is gonna know. Speak confidently and always offer more information (not proof like look at this paper i have as proof of funding etc)&lt;br/&gt;
The VO will take what they need and move on to the next question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time: 7:54 AM and Out time: 8:40 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You got this!! All the Best!!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m on STEM OPT right now, and my EAD is valid till March 2027. My F1 visa stamp, though, expires in July 2026. The reason there’s a gap is because I had to take a reduced course load during one semester in grad school, which affected the visa validity.

From what I’ve confirmed with my school and immigration attorneys, I’m totally fine staying in the U.S. till my STEM OPT ends in 2027, even if the visa stamp expires — since the visa is just for re-entry, not for staying.

Now, I’m thinking of going to India for a visit in August this year, and while my visa will still be valid at that time (expiring July 2026), which is still almost a year before my visa stamp expires. While I technically should be fine re-entering the U.S. 

I’m a bit nervous. I keep hearing mixed things lately about re-entry risks, especially with the current climate around immigration.

Has anyone been in a similar boat — traveling while your visa is still valid but within a year of expiry? Would you recommend going, or better to wait it out? Just trying to get some real-world experiences before making a decision.

Appreciate any advice. Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,

Here’s my situation: I’m currently on an F1 visa and will be applying for OPT this June. My lease in the U.S. ends in July, so I plan to return to India once my lease is up. My plan is to apply for jobs in the U.S. remotely from India while waiting for my EAD (Employment Authorization Document) to be approved.

I’m aware of the 90-day unemployment limit on OPT (which can be extended to 150 days for STEM OPT), so my intention is to actively job search while abroad. However, if I’m unable to secure a job within the allowed period of unemployment, I plan to stay in India permanently.

I’m curious how others have handled this:

* Has anyone applied for jobs while abroad during OPT?
* How did you manage your U.S. address and the delivery of your EAD card while you were outside the U.S.?
* Did you encounter any challenges or legal complications while being outside the U.S. during the OPT and EAD approval process?
* Would it impact my SEVIS record if I leave the U.S. and my OPT is pending or approved?

Any advice, insights, or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Posting this for my friend who’s on STEM OPT and currently waiting on her EAD renewal. She already has a job lined up but can’t start or continue without the approved and in-hand EAD card, and time’s running out.

She’s thinking about premium processing but has a few doubts:
	•	How long does it usually take?
	•	Can you upgrade an application that’s already pending, or does it have to be done at the time of filing?
	•	Most importantly — is it actually worth the money? Does it make a real difference in timing?

If anyone has done this recently or has any insight, please drop your experience or thoughts. She’s just trying to figure out the fastest way to get the card.

I'm currently finishing up my undergrad in **Physics** (with a minor in Economics) at a U.S. university, and I'm about to apply for OPT. My OPT would be tied to my **Physics degree**, so the role I take technically needs to relate to that field.

That said, I'm really interested in **finance**, especially roles that use **quantitative and analytical skills** — think financial analysis, risk modeling, trading strategy, and data-driven research roles. I have some experience using Python for data work, and I’ve worked on projects that involve interpreting complex systems, modeling, and statistical inference — which I think translates well to financial analysis.

My question is:  
**Would it be compliant with OPT regulations for me to work in a finance role that leverages my quantitative background, even if the title isn’t explicitly “physicist” or “research scientist”?**

Has anyone here with a STEM degree (especially physics/math/engineering) successfully used their OPT to work in financial services, investment analysis, or similar roles?  
How did you frame the job as being related to your major? Did your employer have to provide a justification?

Would appreciate any insight — trying to stay compliant but also pursue what I’m genuinely interested in.

Where: Florence

He was asked about how his tuition is being paid for- he has close friends in the US who are paying. The officer asked how he knows them- He explained the relationship since he use to be J1 and that was who he use to work for. Officer asked where he lived- he said with them but he’s moving out once he gets back (we’re moving in together!).

VO: So you’re going to SJSU for MS in Computer Engineering?
Me: Yes that’s right. But MS in Software Engineering. (She said “But i-20 mentions different name, is there something wrong?”. I explained about the i20 name corresponding to the cip code of stem courses and actual course being different)

VO: What have you done in your bachelors?
Me: I started normally with “I’ve done Btech in CS etc etc”. She’s like did I ask you about that? Just tell me what you did in your bachelors that made you choose this course. Don’t overshare.”. I quickly shifted the convo to my courses, internships, projects and post bachelors workex. And I also slid in the intent to return to India just to be safe. She also cross questioned a lot when I spoke about internships and coursework etc which I don’t remember much. (1 question I specifically remember was : Do you know the responsibilities of software architect that you have been mentioning. I was like (confidently) “Yes ofcourse. Do you want to me explain it to you.” She says no no that’s fine.

Vo: Are you taking a loan?
Me: Yes. (Before I could say anything else, she was like “Your i-20 mentions entire coverage through loan, are you this reliant on it?”. I explained about my father’s and my own contribution and his income, the property and assets we have over here etc. And in worst case I’ll take care of myself in terms of repaying the loan after I move back.”

Vo: So, you seem to have a sibling working in the US on h1b? Would you like to follow the same path?
Me: (I was shocked but maintained my composure) No, I actually have a younger sibling who’s yet to pass out of school. No elder sibling whatsoever.

Vo: Did you apply to any other universities?
Me: Yes I have admits from suny, asu, uci etc. and rejects from vtech &amp; tamu. (She was like I know UB also is very good. Why sjsu over suny. So I answered in detail honestly. But she was like “Not convincing enough. Tell me more”. I still maintained composure and was specific about how the niche courses offered will help me in the future roles I wish to take up etc and that UB’s course was generic &amp; had a lot of courses that don’t add value to my existent background. And I’ll derived max fruitfulness from sjsu’s course instead. The she seemed convinced.

I’m getting married by the end of this year and had a few questions regarding a change of status for my future spouse.

I’m currently on Day 1 CPT with Humphreys University, which is a well-known and relatively safe Day 1 CPT school located in California. I work full-time in Dallas, Texas and travel to California once every quarter for the required in-person classes, as per the university’s policy.

My fiancée is currently on F1 OPT, and after our marriage, I would like to change her status to F2 dependent while both of us remain within the U.S. (without traveling internationally).

My Questions:

	1.	Given my Day 1 CPT university and the fact that I work in a different state, will this affect the approval of her F1 to F2 change of status?

	2.	Has anyone in a similar situation had success with F2 approvals?

	3.	What is the typical timeline for F1 to F2 change of status these days?

	4.	What documents or steps should I be prepared for to ensure the process goes smoothly?

I’d really appreciate advice from anyone who has done this before, especially those in Day 1 CPT programs with out-of-state work setups.

Thank you!

Looking for some advice. I am a PhD student in the US who needs to renew my F1 visa which is due to expire at the start of August. I am currently back visiting family in my home country. Given the evolving situation (paused appointments and threat of higher scrutiny for future appointments) I would rather return to the USA soon before my visa expiration date.

Is the F1 visa like one's passport where, sometimes, you need X number of months before it expires to travel? Is it possible to enter the USA with a valid visa even if there is only a few days before it expires, say at the end of July? Does having a few days (or a week) left increase the suspicion and risk at the airport that I might be denied entry? Would having a few weeks left before my visa expires look better?

Hey guys! Just wanted to share my F1 visa experience from the Chennai consulate today. My appointment was at 9 AM, and I was eventually called to Counter 12 (a young Asian-American lady VO).

Wait Time:

I had to wait around 40 minutes in the queue before my turn came. The person right before me was going for a PhD and hadn’t paid the visa fee (~$350), but he still wasn’t rejected. I believe his tuition was fully funded, so the VO told him his visa would be processed once he paid the fee. He kept asking whether he had to come again, and she advised him to ask the staff.

My Turn:

There was some chaos going on, so neither of us exchanged greetings.

VO: “Pass me your passport and I-20.”
(She mainly checked the SEVIS fee receipt and visa payment)

VO: “Which program are you going for?”
Me: “Master’s in Business Analytics.”

VO: “Why this university?”
Me: I spoke about the ranking, mentioned a professor I connected with, and how the curriculum aligned with my career goals.

VO: “How are you funding your education?”
Me: I told her about my sponsors, their bank balance, and my merit-based scholarship.

She nodded and said, “Oh, okay.” Then asked me to place my four fingers on the scanner.

Finally, she said the golden words:
“I’m approving your visa. It’ll be ready in a week.”
I smiled and said, “Thank you so much!”

TL;DR: Will requesting a new I-20 during F1-visa administritive processing affect my visa application.?

Previously, I accepted a CS MS (course based, no research) offer of school A near April15th, which is my only offer (yeah this year sucks). So I follow the procedure, applied I-20, paid SEVIS, submitted DS-160, and due to the ""sensitive nature"" of my major (AI accelerators) and geopolitical issues, my F1 visa is currently under adminstritive processing. After some counseuling with DSOs from A school, I don't think it will be a big issue. As I already hold a valid B-visa, came to US before, have sufficient funding from my parents, and will not conduct any research. (My interview for the visa is on May 8th)However, yesterday I recieved an unexpected offer of my dream school B, which provides not only is a better programm, but also provides additional funding. However, Trump paused every visa appointment near my country. Considering my programm starts in early august, I do not think it is rational to apply for a new visa using the new I-20.  


I counsulted school B's DSOs, who advised me to entrer US using my F1-visa and my I-20 from B school directly. Though this violates the ""initial entry"" requirements, they told me every year many students have this issue, by using this approach, none of them got stuck at CBP. (Transfering SEVIS after arriving at US is another approach, but school A and B have some fierce rivalry, and I don't think they will release my SEVIS to school B LOL)

Today, school B offered me a link for the new I-20. My question is: will requesting this new I-20 during processing affect my previous visa application? Or should I wait a week or two (considering processing usually takes less than 40 days) for my visa, then submitt my I-20 application?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

Been seeing a considerable amount of negative posts/comments discouraging people from traveling out of the country and a general state of worriedness regarding travel.

So, I figured I share my experience with re-entry into the States.

I traveled to India for a couple of weeks in May and returned back on 5/26. My PoE was Seattle. **As for immigration, it was business as usual. Nothing out of the ordinary happened.** It was similar to the previous times I've entered the States.

As for questions asked, I was only asked to show my passport/visa, current EAD, and latest I-20. I was called into secondary inspection, but that was due to some mismatch they saw in the system (that's what I was told, but it might just be that the CBP officer was unaware that I can work while on an F-1 visa) and during secondary inspection I was asked who my employer is and what my role is. A friend of mine who I was traveling with was additionally asked to produce payslips, but she did not have to go through secondary inspection.

It's a misconception that re-entry is difficult now. As long as you haven't been involved in anything which could be considered illegal or seen as violation of your F-1 visa, you should be good! **Just make sure you have all your documents in order and you'll be fine.**

Hope this post helps alleviate concerns regarding travel. Cheers and safe travels!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

**Slot:** 8:00 AM | **In-Time:** 7:30 AM | **Out-Time:** 8:07 AM  
**Result:** Approved (1st Attempt)  
**Interview Duration:** \~30–45 seconds

Background:

Arrived at the consulate around **6:30 AM**. It was fairly calm until **6:45 AM**, after which it got crowded quickly. They started separating applicants by slot time (mine was 8:00 AM). Entered the premises around **7:30 AM**. I was behind a family who seemed to have their visas approved.

My **VO (Visa Officer)** was a **kind and composed Asian-American woman**.

# Interview Transcript:

**Me:** Good morning.  
**VO:** Good morning. Please pass your passport.  
(*Scans passport*)  
**VO:** Pass your I-20.  
(*Looks at it*)  
**VO:** So… you’re going to the University of Michigan.  
**VO:** When did you complete your undergrad?  
**Me:** May 2023.  
**VO:** What have you been doing since then?  
**Me:** I worked as a Trainee Design Engineer. Later, I quit to focus on GRE, TOEFL, and university applications. After that, I took up courses related to my master’s specialization.  
**VO:** Why did you decide to pursue your master’s now?  
**Me:** My company was about to start a 6-month training program. Since I was planning to shift from production design to simulation-based design, I informed HR and resigned. I didn’t want to accept training and then leave—it wouldn’t have been right.  
(*VO smiles*)  
**VO:** Place your right hand on the scanner.  
(*I comply*)  
**VO:** We share the same birthday—you’re exactly 20 years younger than me.  
**VO:** Alright, your visa is approved. You’ll receive it within a week.

Be short, polite, and to the point. Be confident, stay honest, and know your answers well. The VO was warm and friendly—it really helped ease the nerves. Next to me in line, there was someone applying to **Boston University** for a **software engineering program**. Shockingly, her visa was **rejected without a single question** asked—she just handed over her documents, and that was it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; US Embassy, Chennai, India&lt;br/&gt;

I’m looking for some urgent advice regarding my immigrant visa situation under the F4 category. My father is the principal applicant (petition filed by his U.S. citizen brother in 2007), and we have finally been scheduled for a visa interview on July 14, 2025 at the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Here are the key dates:

Priority Date: August 29, 2007

I-130 Approval Date: April 10, 2010

Documentarily Qualified: February 1, 2021

My DOB: July 20, 2000

I'm currently in the U.S. on an F-1 visa, finishing my Master's program on June 1, 2025, and my OPT starts June 15, 2025. I'm worried I might be aged out under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) by the time of the interview.

My concern is:
If I travel to Bangladesh and get deemed ineligible due to aging out, I may not be able to return to the U.S. as my degree will already end and I may not have any job offer at the time of return.

Questions:

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

How likely is it that I still qualify under CSPA?

Has anyone had luck contacting the U.S. Embassy beforehand and getting clarity?

What are my options to safely handle this without risking my legal status in the U.S.?

Any thoughts or shared experiences would be extremely appreciated. I’m also planning to consult an immigration lawyer, but wanted to gather community input too. Thanks in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

Why This Is a Problem? 

Timing Issue
Most international students who begin programs in August or September typically apply for their visas between May and July. This freeze could cause major delays in getting a visa issued in time.

Academic Impact
Without a valid visa, students cannot enter the U.S. and may be forced to miss the start of their program and nlthen need to defer their admission. 

---

What We Don't Know

The order doesn't say how long the freeze will last. The expectation is a few days to 3 weeks. However, it's not possible to actually say how long it will be. 

Further instructions are expected to come in a “separate telegram” (also called a septel), leaving both students and universities without clear timelines.

---

Context

This freeze appears to be connected to planned expansions in social media screening for applicants. It may be related to heightened concerns about protests, terrorism, or ""antisemitism"".

1kx8uq8,Worried About the OPT Program Being Terminated? Here's Why It's Not That Simple,Codetornado,209,0,209,0.93,33,1748408970,2025-05-28T05:09:30.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/1kx8uq8/worried_about_the_opt_program_being_terminated/,https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/1kx8uq8/worried_about_the_opt_program_being_terminated/,"You may have seen headlines or social media posts about a Trump nominee wanting to terminate the OPT (Optional Practical Training) program. While that might sound alarming, it's incredibly hard to dismantle a well-established program like OPT—and it wouldn’t affect current students or those already on OPT. 

Here's a simplified breakdown of how complex it is to actually end OPT:

1. USCIS Has to Draft a Proposed Rule
The rule must go through internal review within USCIS and then through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). 


2. Economic Impact Review
Approximately 200,000 students use OPT annually. Any rule change would have a massive economic impact to the US. When th economic impact is over $100 million (which this clearly is going to be), it triggers extra scrutiny under ""major rule"" protections.


3. OMB Review (Office of Management and Budget)
OMB checks that all economic and procedural analyses are sound. (Fun fact: the Trump administration once tried to kill H-4 EAD, but it failed at this step due to bad analysis.) 


4. Public Comment Period
If it was approved by OBM then the rule is published in the Federal Register, where the public (including universities, businesses, students, etc.) can comment. Agencies must consider all feedback and make changes if needed before finalizing anything.


5. Congress Can Step In
The Congressional Review Act lets Congress reject major rules. Most states have universities that rely on international students heavily for funding. The lobbying power of colleges and universities along with other entities like large tech companies will push back hard.


Tl;dr: Ending OPT isn’t as easy as a tweet or a press release. It is a multi-step legal and bureaucratic process. Current students on OPT, you should not have any immediate concerns.


STEM OPT and Rule Changes: What You Should Know

Just like standard OPT, STEM OPT is governed by federal regulations. So any attempt to remove or alter STEM OPT has to go through the same slow and heavily scrutinized process. Additionally, because STEM OPT was created through a formal rulemaking process in 2016, ending it would require reversing or replacing that rule. Here’s what that means:

1. A New Rule Would Be Required
DHS would have to propose a new rule eliminating or modifying STEM OPT, which would trigger internal reviews, economic analysis, and legal justification—especially since STEM OPT was introduced to address concerns about the original program.

2. Even More Legal Risk
The 2016 rule that established STEM OPT was created in response to lawsuits that struck down earlier versions due to procedural errors. This means any attempt to repeal STEM OPT would likely face immediate legal challenges. Process violations are taken seriously.

3. Higher Economic Impact
STEM OPT holders tyoically work in high-demand high-pay and high-impact industries like tech and engineering. Eliminating work authorization would have a major economic ripple effect one that's likely to exceed the $100 million threshold that triggers additional oversight same as OPT above. 


4. Universities and Employers during Public Comment Period
Colleges, tech companies, and research institutions rely heavily on STEM OPT. Expect them to flood the public comment process and lobby Congress if any serious threat emerges. These groups have the political and financial influence to slow or stop changes.


5. Congressional Review Still Applies
Like with regular OPT, Congress could block any regulation targeting STEM OPT under the Congressional Review Act. Many lawmakers from both parties represent states with tech sectors and universities that benefit from this program. Again, like OPT expect lots of political pressure. 

---

TL;DR: Ending STEM OPT is legally and politically difficult. It would take years, face legal pushback, and affect powerful stakeholders across the US. If you’re currently in a STEM OPT program or planning for it,l in the near future you are not at immediate risk. OPT and STEM OPT are not easily overturned overnight via a tweet or a memo.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have seen headlines or social media posts about a Trump nominee wanting to terminate the OPT (Optional Practical Training) program. While that might sound alarming, it&amp;#39;s incredibly hard to dismantle a well-established program like OPT—and it wouldn’t affect current students or those already on OPT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a simplified breakdown of how complex it is to actually end OPT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;USCIS Has to Draft a Proposed Rule
The rule must go through internal review within USCIS and then through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic Impact Review
Approximately 200,000 students use OPT annually. Any rule change would have a massive economic impact to the US. When th economic impact is over $100 million (which this clearly is going to be), it triggers extra scrutiny under &amp;quot;major rule&amp;quot; protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OMB Review (Office of Management and Budget)
OMB checks that all economic and procedural analyses are sound. (Fun fact: the Trump administration once tried to kill H-4 EAD, but it failed at this step due to bad analysis.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Comment Period
If it was approved by OBM then the rule is published in the Federal Register, where the public (including universities, businesses, students, etc.) can comment. Agencies must consider all feedback and make changes if needed before finalizing anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress Can Step In
The Congressional Review Act lets Congress reject major rules. Most states have universities that rely on international students heavily for funding. The lobbying power of colleges and universities along with other entities like large tech companies will push back hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: Ending OPT isn’t as easy as a tweet or a press release. It is a multi-step legal and bureaucratic process. Current students on OPT, you should not have any immediate concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STEM OPT and Rule Changes: What You Should Know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like standard OPT, STEM OPT is governed by federal regulations. So any attempt to remove or alter STEM OPT has to go through the same slow and heavily scrutinized process. Additionally, because STEM OPT was created through a formal rulemaking process in 2016, ending it would require reversing or replacing that rule. Here’s what that means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Rule Would Be Required
DHS would have to propose a new rule eliminating or modifying STEM OPT, which would trigger internal reviews, economic analysis, and legal justification—especially since STEM OPT was introduced to address concerns about the original program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even More Legal Risk
The 2016 rule that established STEM OPT was created in response to lawsuits that struck down earlier versions due to procedural errors. This means any attempt to repeal STEM OPT would likely face immediate legal challenges. Process violations are taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher Economic Impact
STEM OPT holders tyoically work in high-demand high-pay and high-impact industries like tech and engineering. Eliminating work authorization would have a major economic ripple effect one that&amp;#39;s likely to exceed the $100 million threshold that triggers additional oversight same as OPT above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universities and Employers during Public Comment Period
Colleges, tech companies, and research institutions rely heavily on STEM OPT. Expect them to flood the public comment process and lobby Congress if any serious threat emerges. These groups have the political and financial influence to slow or stop changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congressional Review Still Applies
Like with regular OPT, Congress could block any regulation targeting STEM OPT under the Congressional Review Act. Many lawmakers from both parties represent states with tech sectors and universities that benefit from this program. Again, like OPT expect lots of political pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

I’m an international student on an F-1 visa currently studying in the U.S. A couple of weeks ago, I was involved in a car accident that was my fault. It had just rained, the roads were slick, and I didn’t leave enough space between me and the car in front of me. I rear-ended that vehicle, and as a result, that car lightly hit the one in front of it. So, in total, there were two other vehicles involved besides mine.

The first vehicle (a Ford F-150) only had two small scratches on the bumper. The car I directly hit had front and rear bumper damage. No one was injured and no one went to the hospital or took an ambulance at the scene. However, the driver of the car I hit hired an injury attorney.

The police gave me two citations:
	1.	Following too closely
	2.	Worn tires

My court date is scheduled for July 10. I already have a flight booked for July 14 to visit my family in a Middle Eastern country and plan to return before the fall semester.

Given that I’m on an F-1 visa, I’m really worried — could this accident or the citations jeopardize my visa status or cause issues when re-entering the U.S.? Is it risky to leave the country before resolving everything fully?

I’m in a bit of a confusing situation and would really appreciate some insights.

I applied for OPT within the 90-day window after my graduation and chose a start date well within the 60-day grace period — specifically June 30, 2025. However, when my OPT was approved, USCIS set my start date as July 10, 2025 — which is technically the 61st day after my program end date.

Just to clarify:

* I filed everything on time.
* There was no delay or RFE.
* The only issue is that the start date they assigned is **one day past** the 60-day grace period.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Will this cause any legal issues or status problems? I'm worried because I’ve always heard your OPT start date *must* be within the 60-day period post-graduation.

Any advice or similar experiences would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I really need help or advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation.

I’m an F-1 student graduating this summer (August 6, 2025), and I recently made a mistake — I submitted my **I-765 OPT application online on May 19, 2025**, *before* receiving my OPT I-20 from my DSO. I now understand that this was a major error, as the I-20 is a required document and must be issued **within 30 days before submission**.

My OPT I-20 hasn’t been issued yet, but I’ve already received my USCIS receipt notice. I called USCIS and they advised that I **must withdraw** the I-765 and refile, but also mentioned they **can’t guarantee what happens if I submit a second application** before the first is withdrawn. The frustrating part is that **withdrawal requests can take weeks to months**, and I’m worried I’ll run out of time.

# Questions:

1. **Has anyone here submitted I-765 before getting their OPT I-20 and still got approved after uploading it later?**
2. **If I submit the withdrawal now, can I refile before it’s officially processed? Or will that just mess things up more?**
3. **Is there any harm in just waiting for an RFE and uploading the OPT I-20 then?**

I have an appointment with my university’s international office on the 29th, but I don’t want to lose time if withdrawal is definitely the right move.

Any real-world experiences or advice would mean a lot right now. Thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;br/&gt;

📍 **Location &amp; Logistics:**

* The embassy is easy to reach – bus 69 stops right outside, and there’s also street parking (Zone 3) and more at Villa Källhagen nearby.
* The entrance is on the west side of the building (look for the white roof on satellite images).

🕒 **Queue &amp; Timing:**

* There are two lines: one for US citizens and one for non-immigrant visas (yup, that’s the one to join).
* **“The time is not accurate but the line is there”** – basically, it doesn’t matter when your appointment is booked, it’s all about your place in the queue. The guard on a loudspeaker reminds everyone of this, which seems to baffle many Swedes expecting German-style punctuality.
* The queue starts at a little bus stop shelter with seats for \~16 people and continues standing along Gärdesgatan.

📄 **What to Bring:**

* Passport
* DS-160 confirmation page with barcode
* I-20 from the school
* SEVIS payment receipt
* Appointment confirmation &amp; visa fee receipt
* (Recommended) Letter of acceptance, proof of funds (scholarship + bank statement), transcripts, Duolingo results, and two passport photos.
* **Important:** No big bags, laptops, or electronics other than your phone – they won’t let you in, and there’s nowhere to store them.
* **Hardcopy essential:** Yes, everything needs to be printed. They kept sending people away to the nearest Mailboxes Etc to print and come back.

👩‍👧 **Minors &amp; Financial Info:**

* While I’d heard that minors (under 18) could have a parent present, the guard waved this off: “If you’re 16 you’ll be fine.”
* They did, however, ask for proof of financial support: “Before you step aside sir, does she have all the necessary financial documentation to prove she can afford her studies?”



🔒 **Security:**

* Hold up your DS-160 (barcode side) at the glass, show your passport, open your jacket around your waistline.
* Go through an airport-style security screening.

🗣 **Interview Questions:**

Once inside, after some waiting, you’re called (in an order that seems completely random) and asked:

1. How long will you be in the US?
2. Why are you going to the US?
3. Have you had a US visa before?
4. Where exactly are you going?
5. How are you paying?

✅ **Outcome:**

* The officer approved the visa and said the passport would be mailed back within two weeks.

⏳ **Total Time:**

* Arrived 07:26 for an 08:00 appointment, left by 08:53. 
* About 45 minutes of waiting outside and another 45 inside.

I paid the  F1 visa application fee but **scheduled my visa interview after submitting the complete DS-160**. However, I just realized I **hadn’t submitted the completed DS-160 form** at the time I was paying the visa fee

I used the **same DS-160 application number** when booking the interview that I eventually completed and submitted later on. Now I’m wondering:

* Will this cause a problem at my visa interview?
* Does the system automatically update with the submitted DS-160 if the application number is the same?
* Should I reschedule or try to fix something before my interview?

Over the past few months, I’ve occasionally worked as a cashier—it's not a formal part-time job, but more of an informal stint where I go in a few times a month. I wanted to ask whether this should be included in the DS-160 application under the employment or work history section, but its not entirely employment?

I didn’t find a clear place to mention it, but I know that transparency is important, and I’d like to ensure I’m being fully accurate in case this ever comes up in future records or questions. Also, I live in the UK as an international student

Any guidance would be appreciated!

Hi everyone, I need some help with my F1 status situation.

I’m currently on STEM OPT, working with a consulting firm for about a year. My STEM OPT is expiring on August 14, 2025, and unfortunately, I might not have a full-time job lined up by then.

So, I’m exploring Day 1 CPT universities to start a Master’s in Computer Science, Data Science, or IT. I’ve shortlisted about 10 Day 1 CPT universities that start around August 2025.

Now here’s my question:
	•	Some universities have start dates in early August, and some in late August.
	•	If I join a program before August 14, I assume my SEVIS can be transferred and I’ll stay in status.
	•	But what if the university start date is after August 14? That would mean there’s a gap between my OPT end date and new program start date.

Can I still legally stay in the U.S. during that gap? Or do I need to leave and re-enter? Are there any other options or workarounds?

Appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through something similar!

Thanks in advance","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I need some help with my F1 status situation.&lt;/p&gt;

Everywhere I look it’s about 17k to 18k per year and it’s already a struggle. What do I do, I don’t want to go back without finishing my degree, and my homeland is all sorts of messed up especially with the society. I don’t care if my credits don’t transfer and it takes me longer to finish my degree, I just want to finish it no matter what, so that even if I do go back, at least I have a chance at getting a good job.

I’m hoping someone can help clarify how the 5-month SEVIS transfer rule applies in the context of STEM OPT unemployment.

Here’s the general situation:

I'm on STEM OPT, with the EAD still valid.
I’ve been unemployed for some time but still within the 150-day unemployment limit.

I’ve been accepted to a new academic program, and the start date is more than 5 months after my last day of employment (but still before my EAD expires).

I’m planning to transfer my SEVIS record before I hit the 150-day limit.

My main question is:

Does the 5-month rule for SEVIS transfers count from the last day of employment, or from the EAD end date?

I’ve seen language in regulations and on school websites saying that the new program must start within 5 months of the earlier of:

1. The OPT/STEM OPT end date, or
2. The last day of employment.

But I haven’t found an explicit DHS/USCIS rule that clearly ties the 5-month clock to unemployment. Some DSOs seem to use that as a rule of thumb.

Has anyone successfully transferred SEVIS and started a new program more than 5 months after their last day of OPT/STEM OPT employment — but while still under a valid EAD and within 150 unemployment days?

Would appreciate any insights or shared experiences.

Thanks!

I'm currently going into my third year of my degree. 

About a year ago, my friend introduced me to his recording studio. Being an amateur photographer, I started going there a lot to shoot photos of the studio sessions and of my friends that would record there. I soon befriended the owner and he let me be around for their private sessions and photoshoots. I shot these photos for my portfolio, but I offered them to the studio too for them to use to post and to give to clients. At the time I naively saw this as an innocent mutual exchange of me giving them my work in return of them letting me stick around and gain experience. Now I don't go there much anymore. 

Note, he was aware of my f-1 status and inability to work, so I never ""worked"" with a schedule and documents or anything of that sorts, and I wasn't paid of course. This felt more like creative collaboration to me, but I'm sure it's also pushing unauthorized employment. 

Am I in the clear? And if not,  knowing the potential consequences, what are my next steps are so I don't sound any alarms. 



Thanks

I’m flying to the US soon on a student visa to begin my graduate studies. My plan is to arrive, stay with a relative for about a week, and then take a domestic flight to LA before my program starts.

I’m currently an international student in the U.S. on an F1 visa, and I’m dealing with a serious issue due to a naming error across multiple official documents. My first name has been listed as ‘FNU’ (First Name Unknown) on my visa, and my full legal name has been incorrectly printed as my last name on my visa, EAD, and SSN.

Because of this, I’m facing problems with: •	My I-94 record •	My driver’s license •	Filing taxes •	Even domestic travel, where ID mismatches create complications

This situation is becoming increasingly stressful, especially because my EAD renewal is due this July, and I may need to travel internationally in September.

I have a few questions I really need help with: 
1.	How do I go about correcting this across USCIS, SSA, and CBP (I-94)? 
2.	Is there a consolidated process to fix the “FNU” name issue across all agencies, or does it have to be corrected individually in each place? 
3.	What is the approximate timeline for such corrections? 
4.	Will this naming error impact my EAD renewal process? 
5.	Is it advisable (or even possible) to travel outside the U.S. during the OPT period with this issue unresolved? Or is it even advisable to travel outside US regardless?

I would greatly appreciate any guidance or firsthand experiences from others who’ve dealt with this issue. What worked, what didn’t, and any specific forms or contacts that helped move things along?

I started my role in a big tech company a few months back on OPT. Got selected for H1B this year and company did premium processing so CoS is already approved. Initially company was going to do STEM as well, but now said it is unnecessary as you have CapGap.  
My OPT start date is early September, so only a few weeks before H1B kicks in.

Now I wanna apply for STEM, just in case things go south (i.e., given the axe, as big tech is brutal and we recently had large layoffs...). They said they won't pay for it but will give me the training plan, which I said is ok.

These are my questions:

1- Should I apply for STEM? I have to give $200 to get an I-20

2- Does this strategy work? Pay the $200 to get the STEM I-20, and then don't send it to USCIS yet (to save the application fee). Then have my application prepared, and if I find out I am gonna be laid off, I will just send my application the same day (and maybe just call in sick that day, lol) so that I save my F1 visa. I am hopeful to continue my previous hourly job I had. The drawback is that the STEM I-20 is good for 60 days, so probably in between, I will have to ask for a new one.

To summarize: Now on end of OPT, have a few weeks of cap gap, should I apply for STEM, and how to keep the costs low by withholding the application while not necessary? The biggest fear is to get laid off on the few weeks of CapGap.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

I’d really appreciate your guidance on a situation I’m in right now. I’m currently on STEM OPT, and I got picked in the H-1B lottery this year (FY2026). I used Chatgpt to summarize my scenario before anyone thinks i am a bot.

# Background:

* I’ve been working remotely full-time from Ohio since I joined my company nearly a year ago.
* My employer is based in Ohio, but the client is in California.
* My offer letter originally listed California as the work location (likely because of the client site).
* However, I’ve only visited the California site once for an annual visit since joining, I’ve been working entirely from Ohio.
* Unfortunately, my SEVP (STEM OPT) employer address was never updated to reflect Ohio. It still shows California as my worksite.

# What Changed Recently:

* Just recently, my employer updated my internal HR record to say “Homeworking,” but they left the location as California in the system.
* I’m now planning to update my SEVP portal with my actual Ohio address.
* I’ve asked my manager to send a formal email confirming that I’ve been working remotely from Ohio since Day 1, and that the California listing was just boilerplate in the original letter.

# Additional Details:

* My employer **hasn’t filed the LCA or I-129 yet** — we’re still in the prep phase.
* I **don't qualify for the California prevailing wage but qualify for Ohios.**
* I’ve been **paying Ohio state taxes only**, since I live and work here.

# Questions:

1. Can I still **update SEVP** now, even though it’s almost a year late? Will it cause any issues?
2. Will a **manager’s letter** confirming my remote work in Ohio help if there are questions from USCIS/ICE later?
3. If the employer files the **LCA using California as the work location**, could that cause problems since I’m actually in Ohio?
4. Will the mismatch between **LCA (CA)** and **state taxes (Ohio)** raise red flags during H-1B adjudication or later green card stages?
5. Would it be better to ask my employer to **file the LCA using my actual work location in Ohio**, even if I qualify for CA wage levels?

Has anyone else faced something similar? I really want to make sure everything is compliant before we proceed with LCA and I-129.

posting for my boyfriend since he isn’t on reddit. 

he recently got a job offer for an internship after getting his EAD (he is on OPT). however, his SSN card has not come in the mail yet and is estimated to take 2 weeks. idk what is going on with the mail but he’s wondering if maybe he can get it expedited. 

regardless, the company has just asked him to provide a background check. of course, they ask for his social security number as part of it. 

any advice for what he should say to the company? he assumed his SSN would come in by the time he got the offer, but they didn’t have SSA appointments for a long time so he was kind of screwed by that. as a result the company does not know he doesn’t have his SSN yet. he is terrified this will make him lose the offer (we already know how hard it is for internationals to get a job in the US!!). i really have no idea what he should do and i’m also terrified for him. i suggested just being honest and hoping they allow him to wait, but he is certain doing that will make him lose the offer (i can’t blame him, i sort of think it will too). the other option i thought would be to ask if there was another form of background check he could do, but it’s with an external company per usual so the rules are probably strict.

I am not planning on immigrating to the USA long term, but will be studying there and living there with my husband for 3 years until the completion of my program.

I’ve been told that often, boarder agents ask about family living in the USA. I don’t want to lie about my American husband at the boarder, but am also worried that if I’m honest, that it’ll raise a red flag in their eyes, and might even lead to my visa being denied.

I really need some honest advice from people who’ve been through the F1 visa process or have experience with U.S. admissions.

Here’s my situation:

I’ve applied for a Master’s in Information Systems (MSIS). I have a Bachelor’s in Computer Applications with a specialization in Cloud Computing, a GPA of 2.5 out of 4, and no work experience. I went through a consultancy for my F1 visa application, and they booked my visa interview for June 10, even though I had only one admit at the time — from Central Michigan University (CMU).

The consultant assured me they would secure more admits before the interview date, but so far, they’ve only gotten an admit from Concordia University St. Paul, which I’ve heard has a poor reputation with visa officers. I don’t feel confident even mentioning it in my DS-160 or interview.

Now I’m stuck.

My dilemma is:
	•	Should I go ahead with just one admit (CMU for MSIS) and say I applied to multiple universities to sound more convincing to the visa officer?
	•	Or should I skip the Fall 2025 intake and start fresh for Spring 2026, applying myself to better and more reputable universities?

I feel under pressure and misled by the consultancy, and I really want to make the right move for my future studies and visa chances.

If anyone has been in a similar spot or has suggestions, I’d really appreciate your input!

Thanks in advance!

Hi everyone, I’ll try not to sob about what’s happening. I’m living with my brother who had studied and settled in the US after his masters in Business. He asked me to go to a CC near him so he could be able to teach me how to drive and help me out with any sorts of forms from college. I was planning to transfer to a CSU, but my dad said he wouldn’t be able to afford it, so now I am looking for out of state university to get my bachelors in some stupid computer science degree that people say is a failing major and I don’t know what to do. Everywhere I look it’s about 17k to 18k per year and it’s already a struggle. What do I do, I don’t want to go back without finishing my degree, and my homeland is all sorts of messed up especially with the society. I don’t care if my credits don’t transfer and it takes me longer to finish my degree, I just want to finish it no matter what, so that even if I do go back, at least I have a chance at getting a good job.

I’m looking for advice or personal experiences about a situation I’m really worried about.

I was on STEM OPT in the U.S., and unfortunately, I exceeded the allowed 150 days of unemployment. I was out of status for about 25 days before I fully understood the consequences. During that time, I was wrapping up personal matters and waiting for my tax documents, thinking I might have a 60-day grace period like at the end of OPT (I now realize that doesn’t apply once you exceed unemployment).

Once I got an email from my school’s ISSS office warning me, I immediately submitted a “Request to Complete” my SEVIS record and made arrangements to leave the U.S. within a few days. I believe my SEVIS record has not yet been terminated and may be closed as “Completed.”

My question is:
	•	Has anyone here been in a similar situation and still successfully gotten a B1/B2 tourist visa later?
	•	Will this out-of-status period show up during a visa interview?
	•	Should I answer “Yes” on the DS-160 question about overstays or violations, and if so, what’s the best way to explain it?

I acted as soon as I understood the issue and left the U.S. quickly. I want to make sure I’m prepared and honest for any future tourist visa applications.

Any insight or experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I’m currently on an F-1 visa and was approved for CPT for my internship this past semester. NYU’s Office of Global Services (OGS) reviewed and approved the offer letter, and everything seemed in order.

Now that the internship has ended, I’ve received my paycheck, but I just realized it was issued via 1099 (contractor), not W2. There was no tax withheld, which is what made me look into it more closely.

I reached out to my professor (who supervised the internship), and she mentioned that she’s hired multiple students from my uni this way (via 1099) before, and it’s never been a problem. However, I’ve heard from others that CPT work must be W2 since F-1 visa holders can’t legally operate as independent contractors.

I’m really confused right now:
	•	Is it ever okay for CPT work to be paid on 1099?
	•	Should I deposit the check? Or wait?
	•	What should I ask my professor to do if 1099 is not allowed?
	•	With the increased IRS-USCIS data sharing, how serious is this issue?

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently on an F-1 visa and was approved for CPT for my internship this past semester. NYU’s Office of Global Services (OGS) reviewed and approved the offer letter, and everything seemed in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the internship has ended, I’ve received my paycheck, but I just realized it was issued via 1099 (contractor), not W2. There was no tax withheld, which is what made me look into it more closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to my professor (who supervised the internship), and she mentioned that she’s hired multiple students from my uni this way (via 1099) before, and it’s never been a problem. However, I’ve heard from others that CPT work must be W2 since F-1 visa holders can’t legally operate as independent contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really confused right now:
    • Is it ever okay for CPT work to be paid on 1099?
    • Should I deposit the check? Or wait?
    • What should I ask my professor to do if 1099 is not allowed?
    • With the increased IRS-USCIS data sharing, how serious is this issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t deposited the check yet because I want to make sure I don’t violate any immigration rules. My professor is open to correcting it, but wants clear proof that W2 is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone’s been in a similar situation or has dealt with this before—please help! I want to fix this the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

My situation was as follows:

I was on an F-1 visa and had a STEM OPT EAD. Unfortunately, due to an administrative error with the premium processing payment for my EAD renewal, my EAD was revoked by USCIS.

As a result of this, my SEVIS status was also deactivated, which led to the termination of my authorization to work in the U.S. under F-1 status.

Given that my EAD and SEVIS status were revoked, but not my actual visa, how should I answer the DS-160 question, ""Has your U.S. visa ever been revoked or canceled?""?

Should I answer ""Yes"", given that my EAD (which is closely tied to the F-1 visa) was revoked, or is it better to answer ""No"", as the F-1 visa itself was not revoked, only the work authorization?

My initial OPT expires in July 2025, and I applied for the STEM OPT extension in the first week of May. I’m around 80–90% sure that I won’t receive a decision from USCIS before my OPT expires.

My HR told me they got an alert from the I-9 system that my employment authorization is about to expire. I know that with a properly filed I-765 for STEM OPT, you’re granted a 180-day automatic extension of work authorization. But HR mentioned that they have to only submit the EAD card for STEM or i766 on the E-Verify portal to update my employment authorization. They can’t submit i765 receipt.

I’m trying to figure out what the best step forward is:
	•	Can I still continue working legally with just the receipt notice even if HR doesn’t update anything in E-Verify?
	•	Should I consider doing premium processing at this point to speed things up?

Two of my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/13qqb7b/ive_prepared_hundreds_of_students_for_their_f1/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1d4mcbl/passing_the_f1_visa_interview_why_your_country/) are up there as well. 

I get a lot of inquiries from these, and in the past week alone I’ve done visa interview prep sessions for students from eleven different countries. There’s some advice I find myself repeating, particularly when discussing “why this school” and other applications/admissions. To share some wisdom and save myself from having to repeat so much during interview prep sessions, I want to explain my approach to these questions in a bit more detail.

Often, students will answer the “why this school” question as they would in an essay or during an admissions interview. But as I wrote before, this is not an admissions interview. It’s a visa interview. The overarching question the visa officer is trying to answer is “will you comply with the law?” This requires primarily that you (1) plan to actually study, and (2) plan to leave the United States when the program is over.

# TLDR

Your explanations for “why this school” and “why this program/major” should be **logical**, **legal**, and **true**.

**Logical**: Do the programs you applied to and the school you chose align with your stated goals?

**Legal**: Does your plan during and after your studies comply with the legal requirements of an F-1 visa?

**True**: Do your answers reflect the real reasons you shortlisted programs and chose a school? Is your plan for the future something you believe you could follow?

If the answers to the above questions are all “yes,” you will have a high likelihood of getting a visa.



# What “Why” Means

Linguistically and philosophically, there are two main ways to understand the word “why”:

1. The *[causal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality)* “why.” That is, what were the events that led up to your decision and caused you to choose the way you did? Examples of why in this sense are “why did it rain today?” “why did you decide to have Italian for lunch?” or “why is the economy of China bigger than the economy of India?” Unless you’re asking a religious guide, these kinds of questions are asking for the antecedent cause.

2. The *[teleological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology)* “why.” In other words, what is the *purpose* of something? When someone asks “why are we here?,” “why did this happen to me?,” or “why did you do that?” they are not inquiring about the causal relationship between past events and the current state of affairs. They’re asking what the *purpose* is. Answering with the antecedent cause would be obtuse or even rude.

There are “why” questions for which both meanings could be addressed: “why do cats have four claws on their rear paws?” might call for an answer about evolutionary forces and selection factors, as well as the benefits the characteristic confers. “Why did you two get married?” might refer to their compatibility and/or their plans for the future.

Both meanings of the word “why” are relevant to the visa officer, but the second sense, the *goal* you’re pursuing with your choice, is more important.

In my previous post, I asserted that you should have a narrative that explains how you chose your program and what you plan to do afterward. With a good answer to “why this school,” you can address the issues of legitimate study intent and intent to leave the country. And it’s most helpful to state your goal first. If your degree actually makes sense in the context of your given goal, you create a logical connection. 

It’s best if you have a specific plan to leave the US, and your “purpose” answer involves it. That way, you can address almost all of the visa officer’s questions in a single sentence. But don’t make it sound forced, like you’re trying to deliver an “elevator pitch” and tell them as much as possible. Link it directly to your program.

Even if you don’t have a specific plan to leave the US, you need to figure out what a viable one would be. As I’ve written before, pursuing graduate studies is an acceptable answer, but you don’t want to say you would *only* do that in the US.

Here’s a chart that can help you understand the difference between *causal* and *teleological* explanations:

| “Why” Question | Causal Answer (Antecedent Cause) | Teleological Answer (Purpose) |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Why do you want to study in the United States? | My country lacks strong programs; I attended an international school; my cousin studied in the U.S. and liked it | To gain global exposure, build skills, and bring expertise back home. |
| Why did you choose this particular university? | It has a high rank; I got a scholarship; spoke to an alum; my scores fit their profile. | It offers mentorship and research opportunities aligned with my goals. |
| Why do you want to study computer science (or your major)? | I enjoyed coding in high school; I did a project in AI; I grew up fascinated by video games. | I want to develop software solutions for underserved communities; I want to work for my family’s company. |
| Why now? Why not later? | Just finished high school; pandemic affected my timeline. | To build skills early and align with industry hiring trends. |
| Why is this program the right fit for you? | The curriculum matches my background and interests. | It prepares me to work on clean energy solutions in my region. |


**At its heart, “I want to [x], and [program] at [school] will help me [x]” can be a complete answer to the question “why this school?”** That will often (though not always) be followed up with more questions, but the next questions will reveal what the visa officer really cares about. 

Also, follow my advice and listen carefully to the question that was asked. **“Why did you *apply to* this school?” is a different question from “why did you *choose* this school?” And “why [school]?” could mean either or both.**

Culture, geography, campus resources may be more relevant to the shortlisting process than the ultimate selection. And don’t forget that affordability and potential for scholarships are perfectly legitimate reasons to apply somewhere.

## “Why did you choose [school] over others you got into?”

**It’s really important to tell the truth here.** Again, it’s not an admissions essay. It’s OK to acknowledge that a college may not have the superior program, and you chose it because it’s more affordable. **It’s much more important for the visa officer to be confident you will be able to afford your education than it is for them to think you’re going to the best possible program.** 

You should talk about geography, culture, campus resources, class sizes, and professors only if those were relevant to this particular decision. As I mentioned in my previous post, it might be true that a college is in a quiet setting, there is a collaborative culture, there are state-of-the-art labs, classes are small, and there are award-winning faculty on campus. But if you would have chosen the university you did without any of these factors, then they’re not important. The right answer is very situation- and context-dependent, which is why I can’t usually answer “is this a good answer to the question of why I chose this college?”

## Why this major/program?

I also recommend focusing on the telelogical explanations for why you chose the major or degree program. If the reason makes sense to the visa officer (logical), it complies with the law (legal), and your answer reflects actual reasons (true), then getting your visa will be easy. 

# More on related questions

## “Where else did you apply?”

The purpose of this question is to determine whether your choices in the admissions process rationally reflected your goals. If you say you chose a school because of geography, it won’t make much sense if you applied all over the country. If you want to study engineering, it won’t make sense if you applied to a bunch of liberal arts colleges that don’t even offer engineering. 

You don’t have to list every single place you applied, especially if you applied to more than five schools. You can list a few and ask if the visa officer wants you to list more. Usually they’ll say no, it’s OK. Again, they’re not an admissions officer or alumni interviewer who wants to know who their university’s competition is this year. They’re just checking your narrative. This is where you can be strategic and list schools that might be more similar to the one you ultimately chose. You’re answering the question truthfully, but you’re potentially avoiding raising suspicion.

## “Where else were you accepted?”

Your strategy here should be similar. It’s usually best just to list them all. But if it’s a long list, just name a few and offer to list more. If you are asked to list them all, don’t deliberately omit any school you were accepted to just because you think it’s “too different.” Your visa won’t be rejected just because you applied to one school that doesn’t fit perfectly into your narrative, but it will be rejected if it looks like you’re hiding something.


# A note about undergraduate vs. graduate F-1 interviews 

Undergraduate students are given more flexibility, although a clear and specific goal after graduation can be helpful *if you have one*. Visa officers know about American college culture, and students can feel more comfortable answering the traditional “why major” explanations including antecedent causes like prior interests and experiences. Therefore:

* **Undergraduate** applicants can be speculative about their future plans, although should still be familiar with their options for leaving the US. Too specific of a plan might sound suspicious.

* **Masters** (including MBA) students should *always* have a specific plan and know how the degree will affect their career progression and opportunities. This includes the salary ranges they can expect after they graduate.

* **PhD** students can freely express an interest in staying in academia as long as they don’t exclusively insist they want to stay in the US. If the goal is industry, then the same guidelines apply as for master’s students.

Once again, the best answers to basic interview questions are highly context-dependent. **Two students from the same country applying for the same exact program could have two completely different answers**, and that’s OK. It just requires a little reflection and critical thinking.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve already written a lot about this in my &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1kib064/my_post_about_f1_visa_interview_tips_is_one_of/""&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, which after less than two weeks is one of the top results on Google for searches related to F-1 visa interview tips.

&lt;td&gt;It has a high rank; I got a scholarship; spoke to an alum; my scores fit their profile.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It offers mentorship and research opportunities aligned with my goals.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Why do you want to study computer science (or your major)?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I enjoyed coding in high school; I did a project in AI; I grew up fascinated by video games.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I want to develop software solutions for underserved communities; I want to work for my family’s company.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Why now? Why not later?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Just finished high school; pandemic affected my timeline.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;To build skills early and align with industry hiring trends.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Why is this program the right fit for you?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The curriculum matches my background and interests.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It prepares me to work on clean energy solutions in my region.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At its heart, “I want to [x], and [program] at [school] will help me [x]” can be a complete answer to the question “why this school?”&lt;/strong&gt; That will often (though not always) be followed up with more questions, but the next questions will reveal what the visa officer really cares about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, follow my advice and listen carefully to the question that was asked. &lt;strong&gt;“Why did you &lt;em&gt;apply to&lt;/em&gt; this school?” is a different question from “why did you &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; this school?” And “why [school]?” could mean either or both.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture, geography, campus resources may be more relevant to the shortlisting process than the ultimate selection. And don’t forget that affordability and potential for scholarships are perfectly legitimate reasons to apply somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;“Why did you choose [school] over others you got into?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s really important to tell the truth here.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, it’s not an admissions essay. It’s OK to acknowledge that a college may not have the superior program, and you chose it because it’s more affordable. &lt;strong&gt;It’s much more important for the visa officer to be confident you will be able to afford your education than it is for them to think you’re going to the best possible program.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should talk about geography, culture, campus resources, class sizes, and professors only if those were relevant to this particular decision. As I mentioned in my previous post, it might be true that a college is in a quiet setting, there is a collaborative culture, there are state-of-the-art labs, classes are small, and there are award-winning faculty on campus. But if you would have chosen the university you did without any of these factors, then they’re not important. The right answer is very situation- and context-dependent, which is why I can’t usually answer “is this a good answer to the question of why I chose this college?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why this major/program?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recommend focusing on the telelogical explanations for why you chose the major or degree program. If the reason makes sense to the visa officer (logical), it complies with the law (legal), and your answer reflects actual reasons (true), then getting your visa will be easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;More on related questions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;“Where else did you apply?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this question is to determine whether your choices in the admissions process rationally reflected your goals. If you say you chose a school because of geography, it won’t make much sense if you applied all over the country. If you want to study engineering, it won’t make sense if you applied to a bunch of liberal arts colleges that don’t even offer engineering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to list every single place you applied, especially if you applied to more than five schools. You can list a few and ask if the visa officer wants you to list more. Usually they’ll say no, it’s OK. Again, they’re not an admissions officer or alumni interviewer who wants to know who their university’s competition is this year. They’re just checking your narrative. This is where you can be strategic and list schools that might be more similar to the one you ultimately chose. You’re answering the question truthfully, but you’re potentially avoiding raising suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;“Where else were you accepted?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your strategy here should be similar. It’s usually best just to list them all. But if it’s a long list, just name a few and offer to list more. If you are asked to list them all, don’t deliberately omit any school you were accepted to just because you think it’s “too different.” Your visa won’t be rejected just because you applied to one school that doesn’t fit perfectly into your narrative, but it will be rejected if it looks like you’re hiding something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A note about undergraduate vs. graduate F-1 interviews&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undergraduate students are given more flexibility, although a clear and specific goal after graduation can be helpful &lt;em&gt;if you have one&lt;/em&gt;. Visa officers know about American college culture, and students can feel more comfortable answering the traditional “why major” explanations including antecedent causes like prior interests and experiences. Therefore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undergraduate&lt;/strong&gt; applicants can be speculative about their future plans, although should still be familiar with their options for leaving the US. Too specific of a plan might sound suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masters&lt;/strong&gt; (including MBA) students should &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have a specific plan and know how the degree will affect their career progression and opportunities. This includes the salary ranges they can expect after they graduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PhD&lt;/strong&gt; students can freely express an interest in staying in academia as long as they don’t exclusively insist they want to stay in the US. If the goal is industry, then the same guidelines apply as for master’s students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the best answers to basic interview questions are highly context-dependent. &lt;strong&gt;Two students from the same country applying for the same exact program could have two completely different answers&lt;/strong&gt;, and that’s OK. It just requires a little reflection and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

VO: So which University? 
Me: I am going to Columbia
VO: So which course?
Me: I am doing my masters in data science.

Me: 2023
VO: What have you been doing since then?
Me: I’ve been working in the data engineering department of my company (said company name)
VO: So how is your course different compared to what you are currently working on?
Me: AI ML roles are currently a budding market in India and while I have strong foundations in data roles I need to up my technical skills in such niche roles. Hence I picked this course.
VO: So did you apply to more places?
Me: Yes (VO didn’t ask for which so I didn’t elaborate)
VO: So out of all was Columbia your favourite college?
Me: (laughs) Yea mainly for the courses
VO: So why did you choose Columbia?
Me: Columbia primarily because of the courses it has. There are amazing courses for AI ML departments and also one course I was particularly interested in is Machine learning in the functional genomics which combines medicine learning with data science.
VO: Whoa wait so you know about genomics? What interests you there?
Me: Yea I was preparing to be a doctor so I have a good base idea on medical sciences. This was my chance to combine my areas of interest.

Just be calm and talk like how you would to a friend. You set the mood with your very first words. I was really sure of myself and I started with a smile and the VO maintained the same mood too.

Interview Experience
---------------------------------
1. I went and stood in the line outside the consulate at around 6:50, had to stay there till 7:30, that’s when they start allowing you in. Unfortunately it was drizzling (U can carry an umbrella inside). 
2. Upon entering through the main entrance, your appointment confirmation will be checked before you're allowed inside.
3. Before entering the building, a person seated outside will ask to see your passport and confirm your name.
4. At the security checkpoint, you'll be asked to place your wallet in a tray. Belts are allowed, but no electronics are permitted. Even water bottles are not allowed 
5.  After security, you’ll wait in a seating area with a group of around 20 people for approximately 15 minutes.
6. Then, you'll be moved to another waiting area nearby for an additional 20–30 minutes.
7. After that, you’ll be redirected to a separate building called the Visa Lobby.
8. There, you’ll likely join a large line  in my case, about 30 people were ahead of me. The wait was around 30-45 minutes as the counters were just starting.
9. Eventually, I was assigned to a Counter
10. One F1 applicants were ahead of me, She too seemed to be well prepared and I was able to hear her answer, it was a sort of a last moment revision for me on how to deliver my answers.
11. After a short wait, it was my turn.

The VO is a late 30s  American female. She talked very nice and he smiled throughout the conversation.

Interview Conversation

VO: Hello! Good morning.
Me: Hello! Good morning.
VO: Pass me your passport. I-20 too. 
Me: Here it is.
VO: So, you’re going to Georgia State?
Me: Yes.
VO: What are you planning to study?
Me: I’ll pursue Associates of Sciences in Biology.
VO: Why did you choose Associates?
Me: Actually, I didn’t have two years of math and I got this pathway (I was a bit nervous and fumbled here).
I chose this pathway because I wanted to go to Georgia State University. I was motivated by their research. Their Centre for Neuroinflammation and Cardiometabolic Disease is doing very impressive research. I’m also in contact with Professor Zhi Ren Liu who works in Cancer Biology and I want to go into that field.
VO: Oh, so you want to work in Cancer Biology?
Me: Yes, I want to become a researcher.
Me: Also, their coursework includes some modules such as Tumor Immunology which are missing in my other admits.
(VO continues typing for a while)
Me: I also have a guaranteed transfer to the Bachelors program.
VO: That’s great (with a smile).
(Types again for a while)
VO: How will you pay?
Me: My father is sponsoring me. He has XX amount in his savings account. He is also backing me up with a land property evaluated at XX amount.
(Continues typing)
VO: Place your left four fingers.

The fingers didn’t scan for some reason. So, she told me to place them again. Then, she asked me to place my right four fingers. She continued typing for what felt like an eternity.

VO: Your visa is approved!

I was laid off a couple of months ago and finally got a job offer after two months of job hunting. But after I told them I’m on STEM OPT, they took the offer back.

Now I only have 3 weeks left to start a new job before I hit my unemployment limit. I’m still doing interviews, but either I get ghosted after mentioning my visa, or the hiring process takes too long and they won’t decide before my time runs out.

I tried looking into Day 1 CPT schools, but I can’t find any programs that start soon enough to help me keep my status.

Honestly, I feel stuck. I have loans to pay here in the U.S., and I don’t know what to do next.

If anyone else is going through this or has advice, please share.   
  
And if you know any UX/Product Designer jobs (I’ve worked on VR, voice, and AI/ML tools), I’d really appreciate any leads.

Thanks so much.

On my resume, right below my name and address, I’ve written:

**“Authorized to work in the USA | No sponsorship required”**

I added this because most of my work experience is from my home country, and I was worried employers might assume I need sponsorship right away and reject me.

I was worried that chennai would be super hot and that I’d melt like Ice cream by the time i get in front of the VO. But rest assured they dont make you wait outside for long, there is shade as well so no worries. No need to get an umbrella or anything. 

My visa officer was a middle aged white man at counter 14. He was friendly and asked questions quickly 

Interview duration: 30 to 40 secs

Me: Good Morning Officer!

VO: Good Morning! How are you?

Me: I’m good! How are you?

VO: good good, pass me your I20 and passport

Me: there you go **passes**

VO: So what program are you going for?

Me: I will be going for the Masters in AI systems program at University of Florida

VO: So, tell me about your program

Me: The program’s great, I actually really like the curriculum because it gives me flexibility. After doing 6 well rounded courses covering everything from machine learning to security and ethics, i get to choose electives based on my evolving interests in AI — **cuts me off**

VO: what other unis did you apply to?

Me i applied to 5 universities and got admits from 4 of them - Northeastern, University of Florida, Arizona State University and Illinois tech

VO: Place your fingers on the scanner
VO: Your visa is approved

I was confident and did not stutter or show any nervousness and I think that is key. Also think of it as just a conversation that you’d have with maybe your relative uncle and not as a serious interview. 
The rejections I saw happened because they were fumbling and not explaining sufficiently to the questions asked. They were giving one or two word replies. 
However don’t go about telling unnecessary details because that would only open up the possibility of more questions in the VO’s head which we don’t want.

They didn’t allow to take water bottles, watches and anything apart from documents.

I reached an hour prior to my appointment time, and waited for 1.5hrs before my turn. It doesn’t matter too much what time you come before your appointment, but try to be early if you get lucky and get it done quicker.

Me: good morning officer

Officer: So going to [university name]?
Me: Yes

Officer: Did you apply to any other universities?
Me: Yes I applied to 7 and got into 4.

Officer: Which ones did you apply to?
Me: [told a few, fumbled lil, but recovered] [Told why I chose the university in one sentence at the end, also included a couple of words to indicate home ties]. 

Officer: Nice, what year did you graduate?
Me: [year]

Officer: Are you working now?
Me: Yes I work at [company] as a [position]

Officer: Place your hand on the scanner, your visa is approved and you will get the passport delivered to you.
Me: Thank you [sprinted out xD]

My general advice:
Try to be the most authentic you can be, it should feel like a natural conversation. Just know about the type of questions they ask and know what your potential justification would be. Don’t try to remember it but KNOW why yourself, like you would explain to a friend (but professionally). Remember to sort all documents before hand so that you are not wasting his time. (He just asked me my i20 and passport though)

I might be biased because the officer didn’t ask me much, I am writing this experience as a thank you to all the post on this subreddit, all the best for yours.

Just wanted to post my situation and check to see if anyone is/was in the same boat. I will appreciate any sort of feedback/advice y’all can share.

So I came for my masters in the US in fall 2022 after working for 3 years in India as a Data Engineer. This is was the first time I’ve ever lived on my own and I honestly really liked the new experience that this country has to offer and the feeling of being independent. 

All that changed quite quickly though as I was jobless after my graduation and I continue to be jobless after a year. I have to move back now in a couple of months but I feel so empty. I  always had this dream of making it big in the US and after spending so much to come here, going back empty handed makes me feel like a failure. I’ve done everything possible to get a job - asked referrals, DMed hiring managers and recruiters on LinkedIn on a daily basis. Nothing seems to work. Got a good number of screening calls that ended due to the dreaded sponsorship question - it feels like being on OPT/STEM is a crime at this point. Got a few interviews too which did go well but I ended up getting rejected for god knows what or ghosted after multiple rounds. 

Luckily, I don’t have a loan and I was hoping that I could bag a decent offer back in India with my experience and a masters degree to boot. However the fact that I can possibly never return, the fact that I spent so much money and the fact that I lost so much time nags me so much.

I don’t know what to expect from this post but this has been on my mind for so long. Thank you for reading!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody!&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone,

I’m sharing my F1 visa experience to help out others! My appointment was at the US Embassy in New Delhi on May 1, 2025, at 8:40 AM.

**Background:**  
I was called to Counter 15. The VO was a white woman with reddish-brown hair, probably early 40s. Before me, an elderly lady was applying for a B2 visa. She didn’t know English and couldn’t hear properly, so the whole interview happened in Hindi. The VO looked visibly annoyed because the conversation dragged on for \~10 minutes, but in the end, she did approve the lady’s visa.

After that, the VO seemed a bit drained and paused for 10-15 seconds before calling me up.

**Interview:**  
**Me:** Good morning.  
**VO:** Just give me your passport.  
*(Scans passport)*

  
**VO:** Pass your I-20.  
*(Reads it)*  
**VO:** So… going to Penn, huh? Why are you going to Penn?  
**Me:** I’m going to Penn to pursue a Master’s in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.

  
**VO:** What was your undergrad in?  
**Me:** I did my bachelor’s in Chemical Engineering.

  
**VO:** How many universities did you apply to?  
**Me:** I applied to six universities, 4 in the US, two in Europe.  
**VO:** Where else did you get admitted in the US?  
**Me:** Carnegie Mellon and Johns Hopkins University.

  
**VO:** How are you arranging funds for your studies?  
**Me:** I have a secured education loan of $XXXXX.  
**VO:** That covers your first year. What about the second year?  
**Me:** I can top up my loan anytime, and if needed, my parents will sponsor the remaining expenses.  
**VO:** What do your parents do?  
**Me:** My father is a mechanical engineer working in a private automotive company, and my mother is a homemaker.

  
**VO:** Which year did you graduate?  
**Me:** I will be graduating this June.  
*(She tosses my passport aside.)*

  
**VO:** OK, you’ll receive your passport in 7 business days.

  
That’s it! Best of luck to everyone still preparing—you’ve got this. ✌️","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Embassy, New Delhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Hey everyone,

I got a really strange voice mail (from an unknown number) this morning from someone claiming to be with the Department of Homeland Security. The caller identified herself as “Sarabjit” and left a voicemail saying I needed to appear in person at the DHS office in Seattle (12500 Tukwila International Blvd) tomorrow morning due to a “non-compliance issue” with my F-1 student visa. She said failure to appear could lead to immediate deportation as soon as tomorrow. The caller said my first name and last name initial and threatened with deportation to my country of origin, which she knew.

The message asked me to bring my passport, I-20, visa, transcript, SEVIS correspondence, etc. It had my first name and last initial but seemed very off—no official letter, no case number, and it felt rushed and threatening. The number was hidden.

I’m currently in legal status, attending school, and have not received anything in writing from USCIS, ICE, or my school’s international student office about any issue.

Has anyone else received something like this? Could this be a scam or spoof? I already filed a police report because I’ve been dealing with another situation involving harassment and I’m worried someone might be impersonating DHS to mess with me.

Would really appreciate any advice or if anyone’s seen something similar.

Thanks.

1kawvk6,SEVIS TERMINATION MEGATHREAD 4-29-25 Update,Codetornado,116,0,116,1,253,1745955545,2025-04-29T19:39:05.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/1kawvk6/sevis_termination_megathread_42925_update/,https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/1kawvk6/sevis_termination_megathread_42925_update/,"
# **4-29-25 TL;DR:**

**If your SEVIS was terminated, regardless of it has been reinstated. You still need an immigration attorney yesterday.**

# **CRITICAL UPDATE**

On April 24, 2025 An internal SEVP memo indicates that SEVIS records may be terminated again for students who were previously reinstated after the last round of SEVIS terminations, based on visa revocations by the Department of State (DOS). These revocations often occur without explanation or due process, and ICE/SEVP is now stating it will automatically terminate SEVIS records in such cases. 

This creates significant legal concerns (again), as students may lose their status based on secretive or unchallengeable decisions made by the Department of State. The government argues that visa revocations are not subject to judicial review, relying on past case law that grants DOS broad discretion in visa terminations and reinstatement of visas. However, Immigration attorneys are quick to contend that this policy violates students’ Fifth Amendment rights by denying them notice and the opportunity to respond. Several immigration attorneys are preparing legal challenges to contest both the substance and constitutionality of the policy.

# **What happened in the original SEVIS terminations running late March to mid April 2025?**

""DHS official tells court that agency leadership diverted 10–20 employees to run 1.3 million names of foreign students through database that tracks criminal charges. Took 2–3 weeks.

There were fewer than 6,400 hits (0.004%). But thousands were for charges that never led to convictions or were dropped.

This is the group whose F1 status was revoked by ICE, many of whom also had their State Dept. visas revoked.

CE/DOJ says State Dept. is who recommended that ICE terminate the students' records in the SEVIS system.""

It all started with ICE, bounced to State,, Back to ICE. And ICE is now pointing fingers at State.

#*Summary of Increased SEVIS Terminations and Visa Revocations**

* Starting around March 24, 2025, schools began noticing that F-1 student records were being terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security within the SEVIS system. Around the same time, students received email notifications from the Department of State (DOS) that their F-1 visas had been revoked under Section 221(i) of the INA. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 28, 2025, that the DOS had revoked over 300 visas (including student and visitor visas). 
* By late March 2025, he reported the revocation of more than 300 student visas specifically. 
* As of April 11, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had terminated the records of more than 4,700 international students and scholars in SEVIS since President Trump took office. 
* By April 17, 2025, AILA and Senator Durbin's office identified 4,736 terminations, with 4,713 being F-1 students and 23 being M-1 students.      
* [On April 24, 2025, SEVIS terminations are being reversed and students are being reinstated.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-admin-restoring-student-visas-ice-framework-termination-rcna203024) 

These actions are described as unprecedented, raising significant due process concerns.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**#Alleged Reasons for Termination and Revocation**

**Reasons for SEVIS Termination:**

The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations:


**Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).""
2. INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the ""serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.
3. INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.

**Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).""
------------------------------------------------------------------

**#Connections to Traffic/Criminal Issues**       
In many instances, terminations are believed to be connected to citations (mostly traffic offenses) or arrests with charges that were either dismissed or, the suit argues, were not deportable crimes. While it's uncertain if traffic tickets alone cause revocations, it seems possible. 
The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in certain crimes like burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting, but a majority of terminated students identified as of April 5, 2025, were not connected to such activities and lacked convictions. 

It appears that SEVP is terminating students without a conviction, which is questionable legally. An ""Identity match in criminal records"" is listed as a termination reason. Fingerprinting is strongly correlated with terminations. There are also reported cases of apparent errors where victims were flagged as perpetrators, or even US citizen attorneys received notices.

**Connections to Political Activity/Social Media:** 

Secretary Rubio stated that visas are being revoked if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests, clarifying that while many cases link to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges. DHS announced on April 9, 2025, that USCIS will now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately. Posts perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.

**Other Reasons: Some terminations may be due to other prior F-1 violations.**

The suit filed by Charles Kuck and his firm Kuck Baxter on behalf of 133 people whose student visas were revoked by ICE alleges that the grounds cited in the SEVIS terminations do not provide legal authority for such actions. The suit argues that an F-1 visa controls entry, not continued lawful presence, and that the plaintiffs were in full compliance with their F-1 status. These actions appear designed to coerce students into abandoning studies and 'self-deporting' despite not violating their status.

**#Due Process Concerns and Legal Challenges**

A significant concern is the lack of adequate notice or explanation for the terminations, which hinders students' ability to defend themselves. The suit argues that the Fifth Amendment due process rights of the visa holders were violated because they were not provided a detailed basis for the termination founded in law, nor a period to respond. Educational associations note that the actions appear to lack cause and raise concerns about fairness and due process.
Legal challenges are underway, with several lawsuits filed by students and legal groups challenging the visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Courts are increasingly siding with affected students. Judges are recognizing severe due process violations and lack of transparency, with some calling the system ""Kafkaesque"".

**Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs):**               
Multiple TROs have been granted across the country to block unjust visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Specific examples include:

* A Dartmouth student who won a TRO on April 9, 2025, allowing maintenance of status for two weeks.
* A case represented by Banias Law where a TRO was granted on April 11, 2025.
* A lawsuit filed by Charles Kuck and Kuck Baxter on behalf of 17 students, including those from Georgia Tech, UGA, Kennesaw State, and Emory, whose visas were canceled by ICE.
* Charles Kuck announced that on April 12, 2025, Judge Calvert granted a TRO for 133 plaintiffs, ordering reinstatement to lawful status and the ability to resume OPT/CPT retroactive to March 31.
* A University of Wisconsin-Madison student from India, Krish Lal Isserdasani, won a TRO on April 15, 2025, preventing DHS from revoking his visa or detaining him after his SEVIS record was terminated following a dismissed misdemeanor disorderly conduct arrest. The judge found his claim of wrongful termination had a ""reasonable likelihood of success"".
* The order in the UW-Madison case also weighed in on the case of Hamidreza Khademi, an Iowa State graduate on OPT whose visa was terminated after a traffic stop where no charges were filed.
* The Atlanta lawsuit is asking the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to declare the SEVIS record terminations unlawful and vacate the visa terminations. A motion for a temporary restraining order and expedited preliminary injunction was filed in this case.
* Impact on Students
* SEVIS termination results in the immediate loss of F-1 status and all employment authorization, including OPT and CPT. It complicates future visa applications and can lead to termination of status for dependents. Importantly, F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after SEVIS termination; it begins only under specific conditions, such as when a reinstatement application is denied, an immigration judge issues a removal order, or DHS identifies a status violation during review of another immigration benefit.

#Given the complex nature and due process concerns, it is strongly advised that affected students seek immediate legal counsel from an immigration attorney. 

#My advice now begins and ends with…

#**File a TRO and/or join a class of students in filing lawsuits*  
Students are seeing more success going the legal route over reinstatement.

------------------------------------------------------------------


**What is a TRO?**    
A Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) can be used to halt actions that might cause immediate and irreparable harm to an individual or group. For example, TROs have been issued to stop deportations, reinstate visas, and block policies that negatively impact individual’s rights.


**Legal Action (TRO/Lawsuit):**  

Students are seeing more success going the legal route by filing a TRO and/or joining a class action lawsuit, which allows students to challenge ICE's unilateral actions.

**Grace Periods:**    
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:


**Reinstatement:**   

Students can apply for reinstatement through USCIS by filing Form I-539. This process is slow with uncertain outcomes. For mysterious or questionable terminations, applying for reinstatement ASAP is highly recommended, but it must be done with an immigration attorney. In reinstatement, a student must often assert that no status violation occurred and ICE acted without valid justification. A potential risk is that a denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence.

**Travel:**  

Travel to renew a revoked visa or attempt re-entry with a new SEVIS record is not advisable without consulting an experienced attorney, as the likelihood of denial is exceptionally high.

**Social Media:**   

Be mindful of social media activity, use strict privacy settings, and consult an attorney if concerned, as politically sensitive content could be scrutinized.
Educational associations like NAFSA and the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration have engaged with government agencies and signed letters seeking information on these policies, raising concerns about the lack of clear explanations and due process. The government maintains that revocations are necessary to secure borders and keep communities safe.

# FAQ

*Will I get my SEVIS record reinstated after the 4-24-25 reversal update?*   

Yes

*Will my visa be reinstated?*   

Unlikely under this policy. Possible, but unlikely. 

*Can I work again on my active CPT/OPT/STEM OPT?*  

Yes, once your record is restored. 

*Can I apply for OPT?*   

If you are eligible, yes once your record is restored. 

*Can I come back from overseas?*   

If you have a valid visa and an I-20, yes. 

**As of 4-22-25 are students still getting their SEVIS termianted?**

No. No new termiantions have been reported. Since 4-17-25.

**Are students getting their visas revoked over traffic tickets?**

Maybe. But let’s be real—you probably aren't. So calm down. No one here actually knows for sure, except ICE Officer Jerry, who is undoubtedly lurking and enjoying the chaos. And guess what? Jerry’s not talking..

**Are all students with criminal records, police interaction, or other similar times being terminated?**     
 
Less than 1% of International students have been impacted. Statistically, a conservative estimate is that 5-10% of International students have interactions with police. That's compared with 20-30% for their American peers. So we are not seeing a majority of students being impacted at all.

**What kind of civil infractions or violations (not criminal arrests or felonies or misdemeanors, but like tickets or fines without court appearance) are getting picked up by this system? Does anybody know, given the data we have?**

To quote a lawyer when I asked, "".. it's an absolutely missmanaged shit show.""  The vast majority of students have nothing to worry about, regardless of their infraction.

**Are students being terminated and losing their visas because of their nationality?**

No. There is no clear pattern or trend in terms of the nationality of the students being affected by the visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations. Students from all regions of the world are being impacted.*

**So far, the majority of students with revoked visas are international students from India, Bangladesh, and China… How come it is not highlighted…**

The most recent data has these countries as the top 10 represented in the US. The numbers here are rounded.

India – 331,602 30% of total enrollment.         
China – 277,398 25% of total enrollment.        
South Korea – 43,149 4% of total enrollment.       
Canada – 28,998 3% of total enrollment.       
Taiwan – 23,157 2% of total enrollment.       
Vietnam – 22,066 2% of total enrollment.       
Nigeria – 20,029 2% of total enrollment.        
Bangladesh – 17,099 2% of total enrollment.        
Brazil – 16,877 2% of total enrollment.      
Nepal – 16,742 2% of total enrollment.       

These 10 make up over 70% of the US international student population.

I can also tell you that statistically, international students are not involved with crimes/police at the same percentage rate as above. We see different countries represented at a higher rate than other countries. Taiwan, Korea, and Canada are not interacting with police at the same rate as other countries on this list.  There are many reasons for this, similar types of rules between countries, similar levels of development mean understandings of rules are the same, and cultural differences mean they are not engaging in activities that lead to police interactions at the same rate as others. Several years ago, at a conference, someone showed how Middle Eastern students were at some huge factor like 5x or 8x more likely to have speeding tickets than the average. (I don't recall the exact number, but it was shockingly high). We also see far more DUIs among students from certain countries compared to the average.

I share all this to say, yes, students from certain countries make up the majority... But the data doesn't imply what you think it does. It is because students from those countries... Make up the majority.

Remember kids... [Correlation is not Causation](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/s/5EJndbFlY4)


**Are people with no criminal history being terminated?**

There are reported cases where the victim of a crime had their status terminated. It looks to be an error in finding the victim of a crime and running them as the perpetrator of the crime. There have also been US Citizen Immigration Attorneys who have received letters that their admissions to the US is over and they need to depart. So, some stupid mistakes are happening. 

If your status is terminated, talk to an immigration attorney 

**What crimes are students being terminated for?**  
We do not know the specific reasons why students were terminated. We are making our best guesses/assumptions. The government has not released specifics for anyone's case. Until lawsuits are filed and discovery made, we will not know why students were specifically terminated.

Additionally, students terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)

**Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction?**

Yes, it looks like they are doing so. Whether this is legal is questionable, with the source noting ""probably, almost certainly not"". The ""Identity match in criminal records"" is listed as a reason for termination, and reports indicate that a majority of terminated students as of 04/05/2025 were not connected to activities covered by the Laken Riley Act and lacked any convictions. Terminations have cited ""Student identified in criminal records check"" under ""Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status"".


**Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?**

There is now enough data to say that fingerprinting is strongly correlated to the terminations. Not a guarantee as there are far, far more people with fingerprinting records than terminations

**Should I go home?**

See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.

**Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction**

Looks like they are doing so. Is it legal...probably, almost certainly not.

**Does the policy apply equally to all nonimmigrant visa categories, such as J-1 or H-1B visas?**     
Currently, the focus appears to be on F-1 student visas and visitor visas, but other categories may also be scrutinized under similar standards.

**What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?**      
Gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.

**Are there any protections for students terminated due to administrative errors?**   

Students may argue that no violation occurred and challenge the termination through reinstatement requests or legal processes.

**Can I work if my SEVIS was terminated while on OPT/STEM OPT?**

No.

**Can I work while my reinstatement application is pending?**

No, students cannot legally work while awaiting a decision on their reinstatement application.

**What are the chances of successfully re-entering the U.S. with a new SEVIS record?**

Re-entry with a new SEVIS record is risky and often leads to significant scrutiny or denial at the border.

**If my SEVIS record is terminated, do I have any grace period to leave the U.S.?**             
F-1 students typically do not have a formal grace period after SEVIS termination, unless reinstatement is being pursued or another status is obtained.

**Does unlawful presence begin immediately after SEVIS termination?**

No, it begins only under specific conditions, such as reinstatement denial or a formal determination by DHS.

**What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?**

You should gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.

**Does sealing my record stop me from being at risk?**       
No. Records cannot be sealed for immigration purposes. 

**What types of social media activity might lead to visa revocation or termination?**  
Posts that are perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.

**Can deleting controversial posts prevent issues with immigration authorities?**     

While deleting posts may help, authorities could still review archived or previously flagged content.

**Should I deactivate my social media accounts to avoid scrutiny?**   

Deactivating accounts may reduce visibility but could also be perceived as an attempt to hide activity, so consult an attorney for guidance.

**How can I find an immigration attorney experienced in SEVIS-related issues?**      
Look for attorneys specializing in student visas and nonimmigrant status cases through trusted organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).

**What should I bring to a consultation with an immigration attorney?**

Bring all relevant documents, including visa information, SEVIS termination notices, emails from ICE or the Department of State, and any supporting evidence for your case.

**What about those people who flew outside the US with the fear of detention, which also means we don’t qualify for reinstatement? What are the ways? Applying for a new visa is a thing. But following the procedure of getting out of the country within 15 days since you are unlawful. There should be a way for us to bring us back? Any suggestions, or are there any attorney suggestions?**

Non-lawyer answer... Likely not. First, you need to establish what court would even have jurisdiction over an individual not in the US jurisdiction. Second, the visa revocation makes return much more difficult, as you would need to argue the visa termination was also improper. Which may or may not be true.

**What is your opinion on cases where the students are taking it to court and ice guys are saying sevis termination does not terminate an individual's non-immigrant status?**

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRITICAL UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 24, 2025 An internal SEVP memo indicates that SEVIS records may be terminated again for students who were previously reinstated after the last round of SEVIS terminations, based on visa revocations by the Department of State (DOS). These revocations often occur without explanation or due process, and ICE/SEVP is now stating it will automatically terminate SEVIS records in such cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates significant legal concerns (again), as students may lose their status based on secretive or unchallengeable decisions made by the Department of State. The government argues that visa revocations are not subject to judicial review, relying on past case law that grants DOS broad discretion in visa terminations and reinstatement of visas. However, Immigration attorneys are quick to contend that this policy violates students’ Fifth Amendment rights by denying them notice and the opportunity to respond. Several immigration attorneys are preparing legal challenges to contest both the substance and constitutionality of the policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened in the original SEVIS terminations running late March to mid April 2025?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;DHS official tells court that agency leadership diverted 10–20 employees to run 1.3 million names of foreign students through database that tracks criminal charges. Took 2–3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were fewer than 6,400 hits (0.004%). But thousands were for charges that never led to convictions or were dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the group whose F1 status was revoked by ICE, many of whom also had their State Dept. visas revoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CE/DOJ says State Dept. is who recommended that ICE terminate the students&amp;#39; records in the SEVIS system.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with ICE, bounced to State,, Back to ICE. And ICE is now pointing fingers at State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay on Topic.&lt;/strong&gt; All questions and responses must be directly related to immigration procedures, policies for the recent SEVIS terminations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Judgment or Personal Opinions.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a judgment-free zone. Do not comment on someone’s choices, background, or reasons for termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Speculation.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid guessing or giving advice without clear, verified knowledge. If you&amp;#39;re unsure, do not answer. Any information that is not confirmed or corroborated by AILA, NAFSA, or otherwise publicly posted by law firms specializing in SEVP immigration will be removed. Users will be temporarily banned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cite Official Sources When Possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Use and link to official government or legal sources (e.g., USCIS, IRCC, Home Office) whenever applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Privacy.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not ask for or share personal or identifying information. Respect each other&amp;#39;s confidentiality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Political Debates.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not the place for political arguments or discussions about immigration policy philosophies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Off-Topic Comments or Jokes.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep humor, memes, and unrelated commentary out of the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Clear and Complete Questions&lt;/strong&gt; When asking a question, provide relevant details so others can give informed answers (without oversharing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid excessive or repetitive posting&lt;/strong&gt;—do not repeatedly post the same or similar questions to different users. &lt;strong&gt;This will result in a temporary ban.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt; to keep discussions productive and avoid overwhelming conversations, especially if you are not an immigration attorney, Designated School Official (DSO), or similar professional. Focus on providing thoughtful, relevant, and concise contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No questions about your minor traffic infractions.&lt;/strong&gt; No one here can tell you if there will be a problem. Statistically, you are all fine. Even with the highest estimates, less than half a percent of students in the US have been impacted. They are just taking up space here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary of Increased SEVIS Terminations and Visa Revocations&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting around March 24, 2025, schools began noticing that F-1 student records were being terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security within the SEVIS system. Around the same time, students received email notifications from the Department of State (DOS) that their F-1 visas had been revoked under Section 221(i) of the INA. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 28, 2025, that the DOS had revoked over 300 visas (including student and visitor visas). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By late March 2025, he reported the revocation of more than 300 student visas specifically. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of April 11, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had terminated the records of more than 4,700 international students and scholars in SEVIS since President Trump took office. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By April 17, 2025, AILA and Senator Durbin&amp;#39;s office identified 4,736 terminations, with 4,713 being F-1 students and 23 being M-1 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-admin-restoring-student-visas-ice-framework-termination-rcna203024""&gt;On April 24, 2025, SEVIS terminations are being reversed and students are being reinstated.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions are described as unprecedented, raising significant due process concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Alleged Reasons for Termination and Revocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for SEVIS Termination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the &amp;quot;serious adverse foreign policy consequences&amp;quot; provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. &amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Connections to Traffic/Criminal Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In many instances, terminations are believed to be connected to citations (mostly traffic offenses) or arrests with charges that were either dismissed or, the suit argues, were not deportable crimes. While it&amp;#39;s uncertain if traffic tickets alone cause revocations, it seems possible. 
The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in certain crimes like burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting, but a majority of terminated students identified as of April 5, 2025, were not connected to such activities and lacked convictions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that SEVP is terminating students without a conviction, which is questionable legally. An &amp;quot;Identity match in criminal records&amp;quot; is listed as a termination reason. Fingerprinting is strongly correlated with terminations. There are also reported cases of apparent errors where victims were flagged as perpetrators, or even US citizen attorneys received notices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connections to Political Activity/Social Media:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary Rubio stated that visas are being revoked if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests, clarifying that while many cases link to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges. DHS announced on April 9, 2025, that USCIS will now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately. Posts perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Reasons: Some terminations may be due to other prior F-1 violations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suit filed by Charles Kuck and his firm Kuck Baxter on behalf of 133 people whose student visas were revoked by ICE alleges that the grounds cited in the SEVIS terminations do not provide legal authority for such actions. The suit argues that an F-1 visa controls entry, not continued lawful presence, and that the plaintiffs were in full compliance with their F-1 status. These actions appear designed to coerce students into abandoning studies and &amp;#39;self-deporting&amp;#39; despite not violating their status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Due Process Concerns and Legal Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant concern is the lack of adequate notice or explanation for the terminations, which hinders students&amp;#39; ability to defend themselves. The suit argues that the Fifth Amendment due process rights of the visa holders were violated because they were not provided a detailed basis for the termination founded in law, nor a period to respond. Educational associations note that the actions appear to lack cause and raise concerns about fairness and due process.
Legal challenges are underway, with several lawsuits filed by students and legal groups challenging the visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Courts are increasingly siding with affected students. Judges are recognizing severe due process violations and lack of transparency, with some calling the system &amp;quot;Kafkaesque&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Multiple TROs have been granted across the country to block unjust visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Specific examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Dartmouth student who won a TRO on April 9, 2025, allowing maintenance of status for two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A case represented by Banias Law where a TRO was granted on April 11, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lawsuit filed by Charles Kuck and Kuck Baxter on behalf of 17 students, including those from Georgia Tech, UGA, Kennesaw State, and Emory, whose visas were canceled by ICE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Kuck announced that on April 12, 2025, Judge Calvert granted a TRO for 133 plaintiffs, ordering reinstatement to lawful status and the ability to resume OPT/CPT retroactive to March 31.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A University of Wisconsin-Madison student from India, Krish Lal Isserdasani, won a TRO on April 15, 2025, preventing DHS from revoking his visa or detaining him after his SEVIS record was terminated following a dismissed misdemeanor disorderly conduct arrest. The judge found his claim of wrongful termination had a &amp;quot;reasonable likelihood of success&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order in the UW-Madison case also weighed in on the case of Hamidreza Khademi, an Iowa State graduate on OPT whose visa was terminated after a traffic stop where no charges were filed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Atlanta lawsuit is asking the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to declare the SEVIS record terminations unlawful and vacate the visa terminations. A motion for a temporary restraining order and expedited preliminary injunction was filed in this case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact on Students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEVIS termination results in the immediate loss of F-1 status and all employment authorization, including OPT and CPT. It complicates future visa applications and can lead to termination of status for dependents. Importantly, F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after SEVIS termination; it begins only under specific conditions, such as when a reinstatement application is denied, an immigration judge issues a removal order, or DHS identifies a status violation during review of another immigration benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice and Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot; Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, nor have I ever successfully objected to anything outside of a poorly made sandwich. My legal expertise begins and ends with playing the 2001 smash hit Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney in the original Esperanto. If you’re making decisions that could impact your rights, your assets, or your ability to get out of jury duty, please consult an actual attorney. Trusting me for legal advice would be like hiring a mime to negotiate your contract—entertaining, sure, but unlikely to hold up in court.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Given the complex nature and due process concerns, it is strongly advised that affected students seek immediate legal counsel from an immigration attorney.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My advice now begins and ends with…&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;*&lt;em&gt;File a TRO and/or join a class of students in filing lawsuits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are seeing more success going the legal route over reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a TRO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) can be used to halt actions that might cause immediate and irreparable harm to an individual or group. For example, TROs have been issued to stop deportations, reinstate visas, and block policies that negatively impact individual’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal Action (TRO/Lawsuit):&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are seeing more success going the legal route by filing a TRO and/or joining a class action lawsuit, which allows students to challenge ICE&amp;#39;s unilateral actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace Periods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinstatement:&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students can apply for reinstatement through USCIS by filing Form I-539. This process is slow with uncertain outcomes. For mysterious or questionable terminations, applying for reinstatement ASAP is highly recommended, but it must be done with an immigration attorney. In reinstatement, a student must often assert that no status violation occurred and ICE acted without valid justification. A potential risk is that a denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel to renew a revoked visa or attempt re-entry with a new SEVIS record is not advisable without consulting an experienced attorney, as the likelihood of denial is exceptionally high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media:&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be mindful of social media activity, use strict privacy settings, and consult an attorney if concerned, as politically sensitive content could be scrutinized.
Educational associations like NAFSA and the Presidents&amp;#39; Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration have engaged with government agencies and signed letters seeking information on these policies, raising concerns about the lack of clear explanations and due process. The government maintains that revocations are necessary to secure borders and keep communities safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will I get my SEVIS record reinstated after the 4-24-25 reversal update?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will my visa be reinstated?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlikely under this policy. Possible, but unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can I work again on my active CPT/OPT/STEM OPT?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, once your record is restored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can I apply for OPT?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are eligible, yes once your record is restored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can I come back from overseas?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a valid visa and an I-20, yes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As of 4-22-25 are students still getting their SEVIS termianted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. No new termiantions have been reported. Since 4-17-25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students getting their visas revoked over traffic tickets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe. But let’s be real—you probably aren&amp;#39;t. So calm down. No one here actually knows for sure, except ICE Officer Jerry, who is undoubtedly lurking and enjoying the chaos. And guess what? Jerry’s not talking..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are all students with criminal records, police interaction, or other similar times being terminated?&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 1% of International students have been impacted. Statistically, a conservative estimate is that 5-10% of International students have interactions with police. That&amp;#39;s compared with 20-30% for their American peers. So we are not seeing a majority of students being impacted at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of civil infractions or violations (not criminal arrests or felonies or misdemeanors, but like tickets or fines without court appearance) are getting picked up by this system? Does anybody know, given the data we have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote a lawyer when I asked, &amp;quot;.. it&amp;#39;s an absolutely missmanaged shit show.&amp;quot;  The vast majority of students have nothing to worry about, regardless of their infraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because of their nationality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. There is no clear pattern or trend in terms of the nationality of the students being affected by the visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations. Students from all regions of the world are being impacted.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So far, the majority of students with revoked visas are international students from India, Bangladesh, and China… How come it is not highlighted…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent data has these countries as the top 10 represented in the US. The numbers here are rounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India – 331,602 30% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
China – 277,398 25% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
South Korea – 43,149 4% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Canada – 28,998 3% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Taiwan – 23,157 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Vietnam – 22,066 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Nigeria – 20,029 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Bangladesh – 17,099 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Brazil – 16,877 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Nepal – 16,742 2% of total enrollment.       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 10 make up over 70% of the US international student population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also tell you that statistically, international students are not involved with crimes/police at the same percentage rate as above. We see different countries represented at a higher rate than other countries. Taiwan, Korea, and Canada are not interacting with police at the same rate as other countries on this list.  There are many reasons for this, similar types of rules between countries, similar levels of development mean understandings of rules are the same, and cultural differences mean they are not engaging in activities that lead to police interactions at the same rate as others. Several years ago, at a conference, someone showed how Middle Eastern students were at some huge factor like 5x or 8x more likely to have speeding tickets than the average. (I don&amp;#39;t recall the exact number, but it was shockingly high). We also see far more DUIs among students from certain countries compared to the average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share all this to say, yes, students from certain countries make up the majority... But the data doesn&amp;#39;t imply what you think it does. It is because students from those countries... Make up the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember kids... &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/s/5EJndbFlY4""&gt;Correlation is not Causation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are people with no criminal history being terminated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reported cases where the victim of a crime had their status terminated. It looks to be an error in finding the victim of a crime and running them as the perpetrator of the crime. There have also been US Citizen Immigration Attorneys who have received letters that their admissions to the US is over and they need to depart. So, some stupid mistakes are happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your status is terminated, talk to an immigration attorney &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What crimes are students being terminated for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We do not know the specific reasons why students were terminated. We are making our best guesses/assumptions. The government has not released specifics for anyone&amp;#39;s case. Until lawsuits are filed and discovery made, we will not know why students were specifically terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, students terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it looks like they are doing so. Whether this is legal is questionable, with the source noting &amp;quot;probably, almost certainly not&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Identity match in criminal records&amp;quot; is listed as a reason for termination, and reports indicate that a majority of terminated students as of 04/05/2025 were not connected to activities covered by the Laken Riley Act and lacked any convictions. Terminations have cited &amp;quot;Student identified in criminal records check&amp;quot; under &amp;quot;Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now enough data to say that fingerprinting is strongly correlated to the terminations. Not a guarantee as there are far, far more people with fingerprinting records than terminations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I go home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like they are doing so. Is it legal...probably, almost certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the policy apply equally to all nonimmigrant visa categories, such as J-1 or H-1B visas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Currently, the focus appears to be on F-1 student visas and visitor visas, but other categories may also be scrutinized under similar standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any protections for students terminated due to administrative errors?&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students may argue that no violation occurred and challenge the termination through reinstatement requests or legal processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I work if my SEVIS was terminated while on OPT/STEM OPT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I work while my reinstatement application is pending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, students cannot legally work while awaiting a decision on their reinstatement application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the chances of successfully re-entering the U.S. with a new SEVIS record?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-entry with a new SEVIS record is risky and often leads to significant scrutiny or denial at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If my SEVIS record is terminated, do I have any grace period to leave the U.S.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
F-1 students typically do not have a formal grace period after SEVIS termination, unless reinstatement is being pursued or another status is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does unlawful presence begin immediately after SEVIS termination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it begins only under specific conditions, such as reinstatement denial or a formal determination by DHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does sealing my record stop me from being at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
No. Records cannot be sealed for immigration purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What types of social media activity might lead to visa revocation or termination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Posts that are perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can deleting controversial posts prevent issues with immigration authorities?&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While deleting posts may help, authorities could still review archived or previously flagged content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I deactivate my social media accounts to avoid scrutiny?&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deactivating accounts may reduce visibility but could also be perceived as an attempt to hide activity, so consult an attorney for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I find an immigration attorney experienced in SEVIS-related issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Look for attorneys specializing in student visas and nonimmigrant status cases through trusted organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I bring to a consultation with an immigration attorney?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring all relevant documents, including visa information, SEVIS termination notices, emails from ICE or the Department of State, and any supporting evidence for your case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about those people who flew outside the US with the fear of detention, which also means we don’t qualify for reinstatement? What are the ways? Applying for a new visa is a thing. But following the procedure of getting out of the country within 15 days since you are unlawful. There should be a way for us to bring us back? Any suggestions, or are there any attorney suggestions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-lawyer answer... Likely not. First, you need to establish what court would even have jurisdiction over an individual not in the US jurisdiction. Second, the visa revocation makes return much more difficult, as you would need to argue the visa termination was also improper. Which may or may not be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your opinion on cases where the students are taking it to court and ice guys are saying sevis termination does not terminate an individual&amp;#39;s non-immigrant status?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Where Do I Find an Immigration Attorney?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources like the American Immigration Lawyers Association &lt;a href=""https://ailalawyer.com/""&gt;AILIA Lawyer Search&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=""https://www.immigrationadvocates.org/legaldirectory/""&gt; National Immigration Legal Services Directory&lt;/a&gt; can help find legal aid.  For AILA you can search for lawyers versed in SEVP items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any immigration lawyers lurking or posting on &lt;a href=""/r/F1visa""&gt;r/F1visa&lt;/a&gt; now is your time. For the duration, the ban on recruitment and/or other self-promotion is lifted for any immigration attorneys if you are willing to provide service and/or speak to students about options.&lt;/p&gt;

I entered the U.S. a couple of days ago after spending 1.5 months in my home country. I’m working on F1 OPT. Sharing my experience for anyone it might help.

Initially, I had booked my flight through JFK, but later changed it to the city where my university is based on advice from my DSO and friends. This was just an extra step I chose — not mandatory.

Documents I carried:
I had my offer letter, travel permission email from my supervisor, self-maintained timesheets, Slack and email proof of work, financial sponsorship letter, proof of my reasons for travel, and the usual documents like I-20, EAD, and passport.

At the port of entry:
The officer asked why I was returning after graduation. He himself seems to be a bit new to the process and asked me a few times why I’m returning if already graduated. I said I’m currently working on OPT. He called a colleague, and together they asked about my company, role, and EAD card. This took about 10 minutes. They were a bit cautious at first, but once I answered honestly, they were understanding.

Secondary inspection:
I was sent to secondary. They checked my SEVIS record and inspected my baggage very thoroughly (every item) mainly for typical rules like no meat, veggies, fruits, etc. They confirmed my address, and after about 15 minutes, said I was good to go and welcomed me back.

I’M OKAY. I ENTERED AND DIDN’T GET DETAINED FOR 5 HOURS.

But in all seriousness, and some context: 
I graduated from a Big Ten school in December 2023. Currently working under STEM OPT for a startup. I have no violations, misdemeanors or civil charges. I am Indian. My point of entry was EWR.
This was the first time I’d traveled under STEM OPT. I understand that it is procedure for us to go through secondary inspection, so I was expecting it. 

I was carrying i20, EAD (both), passport, paystubs, W2, i983. They only asked me for passport, STEM EAD and i20. 

Very slow queue. People were getting put into secondary inspection more than usual. Took around 2 hrs, secondary taking about 10 mins. People being taken to secondary were mostly non-white and single. When I was in there, out of 6 people, 4 were Muslim. They took the two Muslim men inside rooms and started asking them questions. Another one had to sign some kind of document. There were two Latino men who went in and never came out. I wasn’t taken to a room or anything, just the desk out in the open. Apologize for mentioning the ethnicities/religions/nationalities but I noticed a very strong trend and felt like it should be addressed. 

Questions I got asked at secondary:
1. Where was your final destination?
2. Why were you traveling outside the US?
3. Where do you work?
4. What do you do for them?
5. What is your company’s address?
6. What is your address?

Moral of the story: enter and exit on your own risk tolerance. F1 feels like it is safer than B1/B2 especially if you’re enrolled in school. If you’re working for a consultancy or anything even slightly suspicious, don’t travel. 

Edit: I also deleted Reddit off my phone and put it in airplane mode. Went to the extent of deleting texts and pictures of me and my GC boyfriend lol ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posted two (ish) weeks ago about traveling and then saw an influx of posts asking if it was safe.

**Update**:  
Thank you all so much for your kind messages and words of support.

\- I’ve finally decided to go with option 2, mainly because it will give me more available days compared to before graduation. I’ve already bought the tickets, thank you so much.

\- I know that my family is the most important thing, more than work, and I plan to quit my job in a couple of months to be with my mom until the end. But for now, having a couple of months' salary would also help me financially to cover her treatment.

Given these circumstances, **I would like to ask if you have any recommendations** since I am planning to travel and return just before my OPT start date. What documents should I bring? Any recommendations or related experiences?  
  
\---------  
I'm currently on an F-1 visa and about to graduate from a STEM master’s program in the U.S. I've received an incredible job offer from a FANG company. For me, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Unfortunately, my mother has been diagnosed with cancer. We don’t know if she has six months or two years left, but it’s likely I won’t have many chances to travel abroad in the near future due to visa/job restrictions. I’m hoping to spend just a few weeks with her before starting my job.

I’m trying to understand which of these two travel options might carry less risk in terms of being able to return to the U.S.:

Context: I have my job offer letter and my OPT EAD card already in hand. My EAD starts on June 1.

**- Option 1:** I still have 15 days before my graduation (May 10) date and the expiration of my I-20. One option would be to travel now and return before graduation. But I’m concerned this might look suspicious — leaving the U.S. just before graduation.

**- Option 2:** Travel after graduation and before starting my job. But this might mean traveling during the OPT period, which I understand can be riskier.

Any advice or experiences would mean a lot.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------&lt;br/&gt;

3. **No Speculation.** Avoid guessing or giving advice without clear, verified knowledge. If you're unsure, do not answer. Any information that is not confirmed or corroborated by AILA, NAFSA, or otherwise publicly posted by law firms specializing in SEVP immigration will be removed. Users will be temporarily banned.
4. **Cite Official Sources When Possible.** Use and link to official government or legal sources (e.g., USCIS, IRCC, Home Office) whenever applicable.
5. **Respect Privacy.** Do not ask for or share personal or identifying information. Respect each other's confidentiality.
6. **No Political Debates.** This is not the place for political arguments or discussions about immigration policy philosophies.
7. **Be Respectful and Courteous.** Maintain a professional and respectful tone at all times.
8. **No Off-Topic Comments or Jokes.** Keep humor, memes, and unrelated commentary out of the discussion.
9. **Use Clear and Complete Questions** When asking a question, provide relevant details so others can give informed answers (without oversharing).
10. **Avoid excessive or repetitive posting**—do not repeatedly post the same or similar questions to different users. **This will result in a temporary ban.**
11. **Limit follow-up questions** to keep discussions productive and avoid overwhelming conversations, especially if you are not an immigration attorney, Designated School Official (DSO), or similar professional. Focus on providing thoughtful, relevant, and concise contributions.
12. **No questions about your minor traffic infractions.** No one here can tell you if there will be a problem. Statistically, you are all fine. Even with the highest estimates, less than half a percent of students in the US have been impacted. They are just taking up space here.

#*Summary of Increased SEVIS Terminations and Visa Revocations**

* Starting around March 24, 2025, schools began noticing that F-1 student records were being terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security within the SEVIS system. Around the same time, students received email notifications from the Department of State (DOS) that their F-1 visas had been revoked under Section 221(i) of the INA. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 28, 2025, that the DOS had revoked over 300 visas (including student and visitor visas). 
* By late March 2025, he reported the revocation of more than 300 student visas specifically. 
* As of April 11, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had terminated the records of more than 4,700 international students and scholars in SEVIS since President Trump took office. 
* By April 17, 2025, AILA and Senator Durbin's office identified 4,736 terminations, with 4,713 being F-1 students and 23 being M-1 students.

These actions are described as unprecedented, raising significant due process concerns.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**#Alleged Reasons for Termination and Revocation**

**Reasons for SEVIS Termination:**

The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations:


**Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).""
2. INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the ""serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.
3. INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.

**Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).""
------------------------------------------------------------------

**#Connections to Traffic/Criminal Issues**       
In many instances, terminations are believed to be connected to citations (mostly traffic offenses) or arrests with charges that were either dismissed or, the suit argues, were not deportable crimes. While it's uncertain if traffic tickets alone cause revocations, it seems possible. 
The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in certain crimes like burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting, but a majority of terminated students identified as of April 5, 2025, were not connected to such activities and lacked convictions. 

It appears that SEVP is terminating students without a conviction, which is questionable legally. An ""Identity match in criminal records"" is listed as a termination reason. Fingerprinting is strongly correlated with terminations. There are also reported cases of apparent errors where victims were flagged as perpetrators, or even US citizen attorneys received notices.

**Connections to Political Activity/Social Media:** 

Secretary Rubio stated that visas are being revoked if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests, clarifying that while many cases link to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges. DHS announced on April 9, 2025, that USCIS will now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately. Posts perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.

**Other Reasons: Some terminations may be due to other prior F-1 violations.**

The suit filed by Charles Kuck and his firm Kuck Baxter on behalf of 133 people whose student visas were revoked by ICE alleges that the grounds cited in the SEVIS terminations do not provide legal authority for such actions. The suit argues that an F-1 visa controls entry, not continued lawful presence, and that the plaintiffs were in full compliance with their F-1 status. These actions appear designed to coerce students into abandoning studies and 'self-deporting' despite not violating their status.

**#Due Process Concerns and Legal Challenges**

A significant concern is the lack of adequate notice or explanation for the terminations, which hinders students' ability to defend themselves. The suit argues that the Fifth Amendment due process rights of the visa holders were violated because they were not provided a detailed basis for the termination founded in law, nor a period to respond. Educational associations note that the actions appear to lack cause and raise concerns about fairness and due process.
Legal challenges are underway, with several lawsuits filed by students and legal groups challenging the visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Courts are increasingly siding with affected students. Judges are recognizing severe due process violations and lack of transparency, with some calling the system ""Kafkaesque"".

**Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs):**               
Multiple TROs have been granted across the country to block unjust visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Specific examples include:

* A Dartmouth student who won a TRO on April 9, 2025, allowing maintenance of status for two weeks.
* A case represented by Banias Law where a TRO was granted on April 11, 2025.
* A lawsuit filed by Charles Kuck and Kuck Baxter on behalf of 17 students, including those from Georgia Tech, UGA, Kennesaw State, and Emory, whose visas were canceled by ICE.
* Charles Kuck announced that on April 12, 2025, Judge Calvert granted a TRO for 133 plaintiffs, ordering reinstatement to lawful status and the ability to resume OPT/CPT retroactive to March 31.
* A University of Wisconsin-Madison student from India, Krish Lal Isserdasani, won a TRO on April 15, 2025, preventing DHS from revoking his visa or detaining him after his SEVIS record was terminated following a dismissed misdemeanor disorderly conduct arrest. The judge found his claim of wrongful termination had a ""reasonable likelihood of success"".
* The order in the UW-Madison case also weighed in on the case of Hamidreza Khademi, an Iowa State graduate on OPT whose visa was terminated after a traffic stop where no charges were filed.
* The Atlanta lawsuit is asking the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to declare the SEVIS record terminations unlawful and vacate the visa terminations. A motion for a temporary restraining order and expedited preliminary injunction was filed in this case.
* Impact on Students
* SEVIS termination results in the immediate loss of F-1 status and all employment authorization, including OPT and CPT. It complicates future visa applications and can lead to termination of status for dependents. Importantly, F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after SEVIS termination; it begins only under specific conditions, such as when a reinstatement application is denied, an immigration judge issues a removal order, or DHS identifies a status violation during review of another immigration benefit.

My legal expertise begins and ends with playing the 2001 smash hit Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney in the original Esperanto. If you’re making decisions that could impact your rights, your assets, or your ability to get out of jury duty, please consult an actual attorney.

#Given the complex nature and due process concerns, it is strongly advised that affected students seek immediate legal counsel from an immigration attorney. 

#My advice now begins and ends with…

#**File a TRO and/or join a class of students in filing lawsuits*  
Students are seeing more success going the legal route over reinstatement.

------------------------------------------------------------------


**What is a TRO?**    
A Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) can be used to halt actions that might cause immediate and irreparable harm to an individual or group. For example, TROs have been issued to stop deportations, reinstate visas, and block policies that negatively impact individual’s rights.


**Legal Action (TRO/Lawsuit):**  

Students are seeing more success going the legal route by filing a TRO and/or joining a class action lawsuit, which allows students to challenge ICE's unilateral actions.

**Grace Periods:**    
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:


**Reinstatement:**   

Students can apply for reinstatement through USCIS by filing Form I-539. This process is slow with uncertain outcomes. For mysterious or questionable terminations, applying for reinstatement ASAP is highly recommended, but it must be done with an immigration attorney. In reinstatement, a student must often assert that no status violation occurred and ICE acted without valid justification. A potential risk is that a denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence.

**Travel:**  

Travel to renew a revoked visa or attempt re-entry with a new SEVIS record is not advisable without consulting an experienced attorney, as the likelihood of denial is exceptionally high.

**Social Media:**   

Be mindful of social media activity, use strict privacy settings, and consult an attorney if concerned, as politically sensitive content could be scrutinized.
Educational associations like NAFSA and the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration have engaged with government agencies and signed letters seeking information on these policies, raising concerns about the lack of clear explanations and due process. The government maintains that revocations are necessary to secure borders and keep communities safe.

# FAQ

**As of 4-22-25 are students still getting their SEVIS termianted?**

No. New reports have fallen off since the end of last week. No new termiantions have been put forward in the last 2 days.

**Are students getting their visas revoked over traffic tickets?**

Maybe. But let’s be real—you probably aren't. So calm down. No one here actually knows for sure, except ICE Officer Jerry, who is undoubtedly lurking and enjoying the chaos. And guess what? Jerry’s not talking..

**Are all students with criminal records, police interaction, or other similar times being terminated?**     
 
Less than 1% of International students have been impacted. Statistically, a conservative estimate is that 5-10% of International students have interactions with police. That's compared with 20-30% for their American peers. So we are not seeing a majority of students being impacted at all.

**What kind of civil infractions or violations (not criminal arrests or felonies or misdemeanors, but like tickets or fines without court appearance) are getting picked up by this system? Does anybody know, given the data we have?**

To quote a lawyer when I asked, "".. it's an absolutely missmanaged shit show.""  The vast majority of students have nothing to worry about, regardless of their infraction.


**Are students being terminated and losing their visas because of their nationality?**

No. There is no clear pattern or trend in terms of the nationality of the students being affected by the visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations. Students from all regions of the world are being impacted.*

**So far, the majority of students with revoked visas are international students from India, Bangladesh, and China… How come it is not highlighted…**

The most recent data has these countries as the top 10 represented in the US. The numbers here are rounded.

India – 331,602 30% of total enrollment.         
China – 277,398 25% of total enrollment.        
South Korea – 43,149 4% of total enrollment.       
Canada – 28,998 3% of total enrollment.       
Taiwan – 23,157 2% of total enrollment.       
Vietnam – 22,066 2% of total enrollment.       
Nigeria – 20,029 2% of total enrollment.        
Bangladesh – 17,099 2% of total enrollment.        
Brazil – 16,877 2% of total enrollment.      
Nepal – 16,742 2% of total enrollment.       

These 10 make up over 70% of the US international student population.

I can also tell you that statistically, international students are not involved with crimes/police at the same percentage rate as above. We see different countries represented at a higher rate than other countries. Taiwan, Korea, and Canada are not interacting with police at the same rate as other countries on this list.  There are many reasons for this, similar types of rules between countries, similar levels of development mean understandings of rules are the same, and cultural differences mean they are not engaging in activities that lead to police interactions at the same rate as others. Several years ago, at a conference, someone showed how Middle Eastern students were at some huge factor like 5x or 8x more likely to have speeding tickets than the average. (I don't recall the exact number, but it was shockingly high). We also see far more DUIs among students from certain countries compared to the average.

I share all this to say, yes, students from certain countries make up the majority... But the data doesn't imply what you think it does. It is because students from those countries... Make up the majority.

**Are people with no criminal history being terminated?**

There are reported cases where the victim of a crime had their status terminated. It looks to be an error in finding the victim of a crime and running them as the perpetrator of the crime. There have also been US Citizen Immigration Attorneys who have received letters that their admissions to the US is over and they need to depart. So, some stupid mistakes are happening. 

If your status is terminated, talk to an immigration attorney 

**What crimes are students being terminated for?**  
We do not know the specific reasons why students were terminated. We are making our best guesses/assumptions. The government has not released specifics for anyone's case. Until lawsuits are filed and discovery made, we will not know why students were specifically terminated.

Additionally, students terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)

**Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction?**

Yes, it looks like they are doing so. Whether this is legal is questionable, with the source noting ""probably, almost certainly not"". The ""Identity match in criminal records"" is listed as a reason for termination, and reports indicate that a majority of terminated students as of 04/05/2025 were not connected to activities covered by the Laken Riley Act and lacked any convictions. Terminations have cited ""Student identified in criminal records check"" under ""Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status"".


**Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?**

There is now enough data to say that fingerprinting is strongly correlated to the terminations. Not a guarantee as there are far, far more people with fingerprinting records than terminations

**Should I go home?**

See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.

**Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction**

Looks like they are doing so. Is it legal...probably, almost certainly not.

**Does the policy apply equally to all nonimmigrant visa categories, such as J-1 or H-1B visas?**     
Currently, the focus appears to be on F-1 student visas and visitor visas, but other categories may also be scrutinized under similar standards.

**What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?**      
Gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.

**Are there any protections for students terminated due to administrative errors?**   

Students may argue that no violation occurred and challenge the termination through reinstatement requests or legal processes.

**Can I work if my SEVIS was terminated while on OPT/STEM OPT?**

No.

**Can I work while my reinstatement application is pending?**

No, students cannot legally work while awaiting a decision on their reinstatement application.

**What are the chances of successfully re-entering the U.S. with a new SEVIS record?**

Re-entry with a new SEVIS record is risky and often leads to significant scrutiny or denial at the border.

**If my SEVIS record is terminated, do I have any grace period to leave the U.S.?**             
F-1 students typically do not have a formal grace period after SEVIS termination, unless reinstatement is being pursued or another status is obtained.

**Does unlawful presence begin immediately after SEVIS termination?**

No, it begins only under specific conditions, such as reinstatement denial or a formal determination by DHS.

**What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?**

You should gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.

**Does sealing my record stop me from being at risk?**       
No. Records cannot be sealed for immigration purposes. 

**What types of social media activity might lead to visa revocation or termination?**  
Posts that are perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.

**Can deleting controversial posts prevent issues with immigration authorities?**     

While deleting posts may help, authorities could still review archived or previously flagged content.

**Should I deactivate my social media accounts to avoid scrutiny?**   

Deactivating accounts may reduce visibility but could also be perceived as an attempt to hide activity, so consult an attorney for guidance.

**How can I find an immigration attorney experienced in SEVIS-related issues?**      
Look for attorneys specializing in student visas and nonimmigrant status cases through trusted organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).

**What should I bring to a consultation with an immigration attorney?**

Bring all relevant documents, including visa information, SEVIS termination notices, emails from ICE or the Department of State, and any supporting evidence for your case.

**What about those people who flew outside the US with the fear of detention, which also means we don’t qualify for reinstatement? What are the ways? Applying for a new visa is a thing. But following the procedure of getting out of the country within 15 days since you are unlawful. There should be a way for us to bring us back? Any suggestions, or are there any attorney suggestions?**

Non-lawyer answer... Likely not. First, you need to establish what court would even have jurisdiction over an individual not in the US jurisdiction. Second, the visa revocation makes return much more difficult, as you would need to argue the visa termination was also improper. Which may or may not be true.

**What is your opinion on cases where the students are taking it to court and ice guys are saying sevis termination does not terminate an individual's non-immigrant status?**

&lt;h1&gt;Rules: This topic and post will be heavily moderated.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay on Topic.&lt;/strong&gt; All questions and responses must be directly related to immigration procedures, policies for the recent SEVIS terminations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Judgment or Personal Opinions.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a judgment-free zone. Do not comment on someone’s choices, background, or reasons for termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Speculation.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid guessing or giving advice without clear, verified knowledge. If you&amp;#39;re unsure, do not answer. Any information that is not confirmed or corroborated by AILA, NAFSA, or otherwise publicly posted by law firms specializing in SEVP immigration will be removed. Users will be temporarily banned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cite Official Sources When Possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Use and link to official government or legal sources (e.g., USCIS, IRCC, Home Office) whenever applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Privacy.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not ask for or share personal or identifying information. Respect each other&amp;#39;s confidentiality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Political Debates.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not the place for political arguments or discussions about immigration policy philosophies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Respectful and Courteous.&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain a professional and respectful tone at all times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Off-Topic Comments or Jokes.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep humor, memes, and unrelated commentary out of the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Clear and Complete Questions&lt;/strong&gt; When asking a question, provide relevant details so others can give informed answers (without oversharing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid excessive or repetitive posting&lt;/strong&gt;—do not repeatedly post the same or similar questions to different users. &lt;strong&gt;This will result in a temporary ban.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt; to keep discussions productive and avoid overwhelming conversations, especially if you are not an immigration attorney, Designated School Official (DSO), or similar professional. Focus on providing thoughtful, relevant, and concise contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No questions about your minor traffic infractions.&lt;/strong&gt; No one here can tell you if there will be a problem. Statistically, you are all fine. Even with the highest estimates, less than half a percent of students in the US have been impacted. They are just taking up space here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary of Increased SEVIS Terminations and Visa Revocations&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting around March 24, 2025, schools began noticing that F-1 student records were being terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security within the SEVIS system. Around the same time, students received email notifications from the Department of State (DOS) that their F-1 visas had been revoked under Section 221(i) of the INA. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 28, 2025, that the DOS had revoked over 300 visas (including student and visitor visas). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By late March 2025, he reported the revocation of more than 300 student visas specifically. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of April 11, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had terminated the records of more than 4,700 international students and scholars in SEVIS since President Trump took office. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By April 17, 2025, AILA and Senator Durbin&amp;#39;s office identified 4,736 terminations, with 4,713 being F-1 students and 23 being M-1 students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions are described as unprecedented, raising significant due process concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Alleged Reasons for Termination and Revocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for SEVIS Termination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the &amp;quot;serious adverse foreign policy consequences&amp;quot; provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. &amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Connections to Traffic/Criminal Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In many instances, terminations are believed to be connected to citations (mostly traffic offenses) or arrests with charges that were either dismissed or, the suit argues, were not deportable crimes. While it&amp;#39;s uncertain if traffic tickets alone cause revocations, it seems possible. 
The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in certain crimes like burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting, but a majority of terminated students identified as of April 5, 2025, were not connected to such activities and lacked convictions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that SEVP is terminating students without a conviction, which is questionable legally. An &amp;quot;Identity match in criminal records&amp;quot; is listed as a termination reason. Fingerprinting is strongly correlated with terminations. There are also reported cases of apparent errors where victims were flagged as perpetrators, or even US citizen attorneys received notices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connections to Political Activity/Social Media:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary Rubio stated that visas are being revoked if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests, clarifying that while many cases link to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges. DHS announced on April 9, 2025, that USCIS will now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately. Posts perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Reasons: Some terminations may be due to other prior F-1 violations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suit filed by Charles Kuck and his firm Kuck Baxter on behalf of 133 people whose student visas were revoked by ICE alleges that the grounds cited in the SEVIS terminations do not provide legal authority for such actions. The suit argues that an F-1 visa controls entry, not continued lawful presence, and that the plaintiffs were in full compliance with their F-1 status. These actions appear designed to coerce students into abandoning studies and &amp;#39;self-deporting&amp;#39; despite not violating their status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Due Process Concerns and Legal Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant concern is the lack of adequate notice or explanation for the terminations, which hinders students&amp;#39; ability to defend themselves. The suit argues that the Fifth Amendment due process rights of the visa holders were violated because they were not provided a detailed basis for the termination founded in law, nor a period to respond. Educational associations note that the actions appear to lack cause and raise concerns about fairness and due process.
Legal challenges are underway, with several lawsuits filed by students and legal groups challenging the visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Courts are increasingly siding with affected students. Judges are recognizing severe due process violations and lack of transparency, with some calling the system &amp;quot;Kafkaesque&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Multiple TROs have been granted across the country to block unjust visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Specific examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Dartmouth student who won a TRO on April 9, 2025, allowing maintenance of status for two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A case represented by Banias Law where a TRO was granted on April 11, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lawsuit filed by Charles Kuck and Kuck Baxter on behalf of 17 students, including those from Georgia Tech, UGA, Kennesaw State, and Emory, whose visas were canceled by ICE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Kuck announced that on April 12, 2025, Judge Calvert granted a TRO for 133 plaintiffs, ordering reinstatement to lawful status and the ability to resume OPT/CPT retroactive to March 31.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A University of Wisconsin-Madison student from India, Krish Lal Isserdasani, won a TRO on April 15, 2025, preventing DHS from revoking his visa or detaining him after his SEVIS record was terminated following a dismissed misdemeanor disorderly conduct arrest. The judge found his claim of wrongful termination had a &amp;quot;reasonable likelihood of success&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order in the UW-Madison case also weighed in on the case of Hamidreza Khademi, an Iowa State graduate on OPT whose visa was terminated after a traffic stop where no charges were filed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Atlanta lawsuit is asking the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to declare the SEVIS record terminations unlawful and vacate the visa terminations. A motion for a temporary restraining order and expedited preliminary injunction was filed in this case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact on Students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEVIS termination results in the immediate loss of F-1 status and all employment authorization, including OPT and CPT. It complicates future visa applications and can lead to termination of status for dependents. Importantly, F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after SEVIS termination; it begins only under specific conditions, such as when a reinstatement application is denied, an immigration judge issues a removal order, or DHS identifies a status violation during review of another immigration benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice and Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot; Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, nor have I ever successfully objected to anything outside of a poorly made sandwich. My legal expertise begins and ends with playing the 2001 smash hit Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney in the original Esperanto. If you’re making decisions that could impact your rights, your assets, or your ability to get out of jury duty, please consult an actual attorney. Trusting me for legal advice would be like hiring a mime to negotiate your contract—entertaining, sure, but unlikely to hold up in court.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Given the complex nature and due process concerns, it is strongly advised that affected students seek immediate legal counsel from an immigration attorney.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My advice now begins and ends with…&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;*&lt;em&gt;File a TRO and/or join a class of students in filing lawsuits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are seeing more success going the legal route over reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a TRO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) can be used to halt actions that might cause immediate and irreparable harm to an individual or group. For example, TROs have been issued to stop deportations, reinstate visas, and block policies that negatively impact individual’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal Action (TRO/Lawsuit):&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are seeing more success going the legal route by filing a TRO and/or joining a class action lawsuit, which allows students to challenge ICE&amp;#39;s unilateral actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace Periods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinstatement:&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students can apply for reinstatement through USCIS by filing Form I-539. This process is slow with uncertain outcomes. For mysterious or questionable terminations, applying for reinstatement ASAP is highly recommended, but it must be done with an immigration attorney. In reinstatement, a student must often assert that no status violation occurred and ICE acted without valid justification. A potential risk is that a denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel to renew a revoked visa or attempt re-entry with a new SEVIS record is not advisable without consulting an experienced attorney, as the likelihood of denial is exceptionally high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media:&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be mindful of social media activity, use strict privacy settings, and consult an attorney if concerned, as politically sensitive content could be scrutinized.
Educational associations like NAFSA and the Presidents&amp;#39; Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration have engaged with government agencies and signed letters seeking information on these policies, raising concerns about the lack of clear explanations and due process. The government maintains that revocations are necessary to secure borders and keep communities safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As of 4-22-25 are students still getting their SEVIS termianted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. New reports have fallen off since the end of last week. No new termiantions have been put forward in the last 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students getting their visas revoked over traffic tickets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe. But let’s be real—you probably aren&amp;#39;t. So calm down. No one here actually knows for sure, except ICE Officer Jerry, who is undoubtedly lurking and enjoying the chaos. And guess what? Jerry’s not talking..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are all students with criminal records, police interaction, or other similar times being terminated?&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 1% of International students have been impacted. Statistically, a conservative estimate is that 5-10% of International students have interactions with police. That&amp;#39;s compared with 20-30% for their American peers. So we are not seeing a majority of students being impacted at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of civil infractions or violations (not criminal arrests or felonies or misdemeanors, but like tickets or fines without court appearance) are getting picked up by this system? Does anybody know, given the data we have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote a lawyer when I asked, &amp;quot;.. it&amp;#39;s an absolutely missmanaged shit show.&amp;quot;  The vast majority of students have nothing to worry about, regardless of their infraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because of their nationality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. There is no clear pattern or trend in terms of the nationality of the students being affected by the visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations. Students from all regions of the world are being impacted.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So far, the majority of students with revoked visas are international students from India, Bangladesh, and China… How come it is not highlighted…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent data has these countries as the top 10 represented in the US. The numbers here are rounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India – 331,602 30% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
China – 277,398 25% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
South Korea – 43,149 4% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Canada – 28,998 3% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Taiwan – 23,157 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Vietnam – 22,066 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Nigeria – 20,029 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Bangladesh – 17,099 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Brazil – 16,877 2% of total enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;
Nepal – 16,742 2% of total enrollment.       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 10 make up over 70% of the US international student population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also tell you that statistically, international students are not involved with crimes/police at the same percentage rate as above. We see different countries represented at a higher rate than other countries. Taiwan, Korea, and Canada are not interacting with police at the same rate as other countries on this list.  There are many reasons for this, similar types of rules between countries, similar levels of development mean understandings of rules are the same, and cultural differences mean they are not engaging in activities that lead to police interactions at the same rate as others. Several years ago, at a conference, someone showed how Middle Eastern students were at some huge factor like 5x or 8x more likely to have speeding tickets than the average. (I don&amp;#39;t recall the exact number, but it was shockingly high). We also see far more DUIs among students from certain countries compared to the average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share all this to say, yes, students from certain countries make up the majority... But the data doesn&amp;#39;t imply what you think it does. It is because students from those countries... Make up the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember kids... &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/s/5EJndbFlY4""&gt;Correlation is not Causation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are people with no criminal history being terminated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reported cases where the victim of a crime had their status terminated. It looks to be an error in finding the victim of a crime and running them as the perpetrator of the crime. There have also been US Citizen Immigration Attorneys who have received letters that their admissions to the US is over and they need to depart. So, some stupid mistakes are happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your status is terminated, talk to an immigration attorney &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What crimes are students being terminated for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We do not know the specific reasons why students were terminated. We are making our best guesses/assumptions. The government has not released specifics for anyone&amp;#39;s case. Until lawsuits are filed and discovery made, we will not know why students were specifically terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, students terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it looks like they are doing so. Whether this is legal is questionable, with the source noting &amp;quot;probably, almost certainly not&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Identity match in criminal records&amp;quot; is listed as a reason for termination, and reports indicate that a majority of terminated students as of 04/05/2025 were not connected to activities covered by the Laken Riley Act and lacked any convictions. Terminations have cited &amp;quot;Student identified in criminal records check&amp;quot; under &amp;quot;Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now enough data to say that fingerprinting is strongly correlated to the terminations. Not a guarantee as there are far, far more people with fingerprinting records than terminations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I go home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like they are doing so. Is it legal...probably, almost certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the policy apply equally to all nonimmigrant visa categories, such as J-1 or H-1B visas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Currently, the focus appears to be on F-1 student visas and visitor visas, but other categories may also be scrutinized under similar standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any protections for students terminated due to administrative errors?&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students may argue that no violation occurred and challenge the termination through reinstatement requests or legal processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I work if my SEVIS was terminated while on OPT/STEM OPT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I work while my reinstatement application is pending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, students cannot legally work while awaiting a decision on their reinstatement application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the chances of successfully re-entering the U.S. with a new SEVIS record?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-entry with a new SEVIS record is risky and often leads to significant scrutiny or denial at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If my SEVIS record is terminated, do I have any grace period to leave the U.S.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
F-1 students typically do not have a formal grace period after SEVIS termination, unless reinstatement is being pursued or another status is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does unlawful presence begin immediately after SEVIS termination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it begins only under specific conditions, such as reinstatement denial or a formal determination by DHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does sealing my record stop me from being at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
No. Records cannot be sealed for immigration purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What types of social media activity might lead to visa revocation or termination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Posts that are perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can deleting controversial posts prevent issues with immigration authorities?&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While deleting posts may help, authorities could still review archived or previously flagged content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I deactivate my social media accounts to avoid scrutiny?&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deactivating accounts may reduce visibility but could also be perceived as an attempt to hide activity, so consult an attorney for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I find an immigration attorney experienced in SEVIS-related issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Look for attorneys specializing in student visas and nonimmigrant status cases through trusted organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I bring to a consultation with an immigration attorney?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring all relevant documents, including visa information, SEVIS termination notices, emails from ICE or the Department of State, and any supporting evidence for your case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about those people who flew outside the US with the fear of detention, which also means we don’t qualify for reinstatement? What are the ways? Applying for a new visa is a thing. But following the procedure of getting out of the country within 15 days since you are unlawful. There should be a way for us to bring us back? Any suggestions, or are there any attorney suggestions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-lawyer answer... Likely not. First, you need to establish what court would even have jurisdiction over an individual not in the US jurisdiction. Second, the visa revocation makes return much more difficult, as you would need to argue the visa termination was also improper. Which may or may not be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your opinion on cases where the students are taking it to court and ice guys are saying sevis termination does not terminate an individual&amp;#39;s non-immigrant status?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Location Cedar Park Texas USA 

I’m an international student on an F1 visa and I just got my first speeding ticket in Texas. The officer said I was going 40 mph in a 30 mph zone. It’s my first ever violation, and I’m a little stressed out because I’m not sure how this affects my visa status or record.

I called the Cedar Park Municipal Court the same day, and they told me to call back in two days. I’m planning to go in person this Friday. Before that, I’m renewing my car registration (it expired in March 2025), and I’ll have that taken care of by tomorrow.

I’m hoping to request a defensive driving course to get the ticket dismissed. Has anyone gone through this before?

Questions:

Should I request defensive driving in person with the clerk?

Can I take the course before getting court approval?

Will the ticket still show on my record after doing the course?

Any risks for F1 visa holders for something like this?

Anything else I should be careful about when I go to court?

I was thinking of paying the ticket off and take the defensive driving course to not affect my insurance rates 

Would really appreciate advice or experience from anyone who’s been through something similar. Thanks in advance!


Update: Speeding Ticket on F1 Visa – Met with Immigration Attorney

Hey everyone,
Just wanted to post a quick update for those who replied to my earlier question about getting a speeding ticket (40 in a 30) while on an F1 visa.

I met with an experienced immigration attorney today. He reviewed my situation and reassured me that this type of minor traffic violation will not impact my F1 visa status. He said that as long as it’s handled properly (either through defensive driving or paying the fine), it won’t show up in a way that affects immigration or SEVIS records.

He also mentioned that many of the visa cancellations we hear about related to traffic violations usually have other underlying issues (like prior criminal or immigration flags) that aren't always visible in the headlines.

He advised that there’s no need to hire a traffic attorney in my situation — I can go to the court, request to take a defensive driving course, complete it, and have the ticket dismissed with no record.

That said, I still plan to meet with a local traffic attorney just to be extra prepared and have peace of mind before I go to court this Friday.

Hope this helps any other international students going through the same thing. Appreciate all the support and advice I got here!

&lt;p&gt;I’m an international student on an F1 visa and I just got my first speeding ticket in Texas. The officer said I was going 40 mph in a 30 mph zone. It’s my first ever violation, and I’m a little stressed out because I’m not sure how this affects my visa status or record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called the Cedar Park Municipal Court the same day, and they told me to call back in two days. I’m planning to go in person this Friday. Before that, I’m renewing my car registration (it expired in March 2025), and I’ll have that taken care of by tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to request a defensive driving course to get the ticket dismissed. Has anyone gone through this before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I request defensive driving in person with the clerk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I take the course before getting court approval?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the ticket still show on my record after doing the course?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any risks for F1 visa holders for something like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything else I should be careful about when I go to court?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of paying the ticket off and take the defensive driving course to not affect my insurance rates &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would really appreciate advice or experience from anyone who’s been through something similar. Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Speeding Ticket on F1 Visa – Met with Immigration Attorney&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,
Just wanted to post a quick update for those who replied to my earlier question about getting a speeding ticket (40 in a 30) while on an F1 visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with an experienced immigration attorney today. He reviewed my situation and reassured me that this type of minor traffic violation will not impact my F1 visa status. He said that as long as it’s handled properly (either through defensive driving or paying the fine), it won’t show up in a way that affects immigration or SEVIS records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also mentioned that many of the visa cancellations we hear about related to traffic violations usually have other underlying issues (like prior criminal or immigration flags) that aren&amp;#39;t always visible in the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He advised that there’s no need to hire a traffic attorney in my situation — I can go to the court, request to take a defensive driving course, complete it, and have the ticket dismissed with no record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I still plan to meet with a local traffic attorney just to be extra prepared and have peace of mind before I go to court this Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps any other international students going through the same thing. Appreciate all the support and advice I got here!&lt;/p&gt;

I was coming back with my mom (on B1 ). We were taken for secondary questioning. I was extremely calm due to this sudden nihilism. The officer was pretty rude probably because I wasnt at my politest mode. Asked for my pay stubs and asked me to show the email confirming my leave. I said I didnt have, I just messaged my manager on teams and said I can show that. He was rude again saying he wasnt convinced of my re-entry. I didnt say anything back , just remained calm - its not like Im going to lose anything more at this point. So I just waited for him to cancel my visa and send me home. But quite surprisingly he said , come prepared next time, bye - you can enter .
Im not sure if its because my mom and I both looked like emotional wrecks.Or because my firm is a good and reputed investment bank here.

So my advise to people who are actually worried about re-entry - just stay calm at the passport control. Dont appear extremely nervous to show politeness.

VO: What do you do now? Me: I work as an RA in the field of Sleep at the University Medicine dept.

VO: And what are your educational qualifications? Me: I went to College Name, majoring in Psychology and minoring in Life Sciences.

VO: So you've been in Singapore for how long? Me: It's been 8-9 years now.

VO: And have you studied in the US before? Or it was a visit? Me: No, I didn't study but I was there once for a psychology conference.

VO: Ok, so how will you be funding the program? Me: Some of it out of my own pocket, the rest sponsored by my parents. (After this, I expected him to ask me about my parents but I was surprised he didn't.)

&lt;p&gt;VO: You said University Name? Why did you pick that school? Me: They&amp;#39;re known to have one of the best Counseling programs in the country so I was very honored to get accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: What do you do now? Me: I work as an RA in the field of Sleep at the University Medicine dept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: And what are your educational qualifications? Me: I went to College Name, majoring in Psychology and minoring in Life Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: So you&amp;#39;ve been in Singapore for how long? Me: It&amp;#39;s been 8-9 years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: And have you studied in the US before? Or it was a visit? Me: No, I didn&amp;#39;t study but I was there once for a psychology conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: Ok, so how will you be funding the program? Me: Some of it out of my own pocket, the rest sponsored by my parents. (After this, I expected him to ask me about my parents but I was surprised he didn&amp;#39;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: How many years have you been working? Me: Three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO: Okay, everything looks good. Passport will be ready in 3-5 days, here&amp;#39;s your information slip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have to show any documents, although I ofc still brought a lot of stuff with me just in case. The day after, I got a text that my passport was ready for pick up and I&amp;#39;ve got my visa!&lt;/p&gt;

Lately, there’s been so much overwhelming news about F1, H1B visas, layoffs, and immigration uncertainty — and it’s honestly making me feel lost, scared, and paralyzed.

I’m currently on OPT and about to apply for my STEM OPT extension. I work at a university, a non-profit organization. It took everything in me to get this job during a very difficult time when the market was low and rejection was constant. I’m grateful for it, truly.

But now, I’m at a crossroads. There’s barely any growth in my current role. No benefits, no clear path ahead — especially when I compare it to what a corporate job might offer. I’m not trying to complain, just trying to express the reality. The only thing keeping me here is the fact that after 3 years, they can file a cap-exempt H1B for me — but that’s *if* I even get to stay that long. The project I work on could end, and honestly, layoffs can happen at any time. I’m so torn. Should I:

* Take a risk and aim for corporate jobs and the 2 H1B lottery chances I have left?
* Try other non-profit organisations that will give better opportunities?
* Stay in this uncertain but cap-exempt job, hoping I make it to the H1B petition?
* Or should I explore something else, like the NIW or O-1 route?

I don’t even know who I should talk to for proper legal advice. I’ve tried exploring grant opportunities for my work, but I was told I’m not eligible to apply for them. I just feel stuck.

I know many of you might be going through something similar, or maybe you've been through it. I’d deeply appreciate any guidance, resources. I don’t know what step to take next, and I don’t want to make the wrong move out of fear.

Thank you for reading this far. Honestly, any help or direction means the world to me right now.

[""THE COURT: Do you realize that this is Kafkaesque?  I've got two experienced immigration lawyers on behalf of a client who is months away from graduation, who has done nothing wrong, who has been terminated from a system that you all keep telling me has no effect on his immigration status, although that clearly is BS. And now, his two very experienced lawyers can't even tell him whether or not he's here legally, because the Court can't tell him whether or not he's here legally, because the government's counsel can't tell him if he's here legally.""](https://x.com/BaniasLaw/status/1912615607654142223/photo/1)

Any information that is not confirmed or corroborated by AILA, NAFSA, or otherwise publicly posted by law firms specializing in SEVP immigration will be removed. Users will be temporarily banned.
4. **Cite Official Sources When Possible.** Use and link to official government or legal sources (e.g., USCIS, IRCC, Home Office) whenever applicable.
5. **Respect Privacy.** Do not ask for or share personal or identifying information. Respect each other's confidentiality.
6. **No Political Debates.** This is not the place for political arguments or discussions about immigration policy philosophies.
7. **Be Respectful and Courteous.** Maintain a professional and respectful tone at all times.

# **Executive Summary:**  

The Trump administration is currently implementing heightened immigration enforcement measures targeting international students in the U.S. This briefing document synthesizes information from legal and educational association updates, as well as a student-focused online forum, highlighting a significant increase in student visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations. These actions are raising serious concerns regarding due process, First Amendment rights, and potential long-term economic and educational impacts. The Department of State (DOS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are employing new methods, including AI-assisted social media screening, and citing broad grounds like ""serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" and failure to maintain status, often without clear justification or due process. Over 4,700 students have reportedly had their SEVIS records terminated as of April 11, 2025. Legal challenges are underway, and guidance emphasizes the critical need for affected students to seek immediate legal counsel. Courts across the country are increasingly siding with affected students, granting temporary restraining orders (TROs) en masse to block unjust visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Judges are recognizing the severe due process violations and lack of transparency in these enforcement actions, with many calling out the Kafkaesque nature of the current system. Students, who have done nothing wrong, are facing sudden status terminations with little to no explanation, forcing legal battles that are now gaining traction. The surge in TROs reflects judicial pushback against arbitrary immigration enforcement, highlighting the urgent need for clearer protections for international students caught in bureaucratic chaos.


# **Event Overview/Summary: Increased SEVIS Terminations and Visa Revocations for International Students (March-April 2025)**

On or about March 24, 2025, schools began to observe that F-1 student records were being terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security within the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). These actions directly impacted the legal status of international students in the United States.

Around the same time, students started receiving email notifications from the Department of State (DOS) informing them that their F-1 visas had been revoked. The example wording of these emails stated: ""On behalf of the United States Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued. As a result, your F-1 visa was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended"". The revocation authority lies with INA Section 221(i), which grants the Secretary of State discretion to revoke visas at any time.

On March 28, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the revocation of over 300 visas, clarifying that this number included both student and visitor visas. He stated that visas were being revoked if individuals engaged in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests. While many cases were linked to pro-Palestinian protests, some involved unrelated groups or criminal charges. Rubio explained that if the information about an individual would have prevented their initial visa approval, the visa was being revoked. He also confirmed that this number of revocations was growing daily. The Department of State has been using INA 237(a)(4)(C), which concerns potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences, as a basis for some of these revocations.

**Further Developments (Late March - Early April 2025):**

By late March 2025, Secretary Rubio had reported the revocation of more than 300 student visas.
Concurrently with visa revocations, ICE began to terminate an unknown number of international student records in SEVIS, which has significant implications for their immigration status. These actions were described as unprecedented, with wide-ranging impacts and significant due process concerns.

The termination reasons initially noted in SEVIS often included ""OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS"", sometimes in conjunction with INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (general failure to maintain nonimmigrant status) and INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) (serious adverse foreign policy consequences). Another initial termination reason was ""OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(I)."". NAFSA began receiving reports of these SEVIS terminations.

By April 3, 2025, attorney Steven Brown noted on X that SEVIS records were being terminated for minor issues.

On April 4, 2025, NAFSA and other higher education associations signed a letter from the American Council on Education (ACE) to the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, seeking more information on the policies and planned actions concerning international students and scholars.

Around April 8, 2025, NAFSA reported that the termination reasons in SEVIS were being changed after-the-fact from ""OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS"" to ""OTHER"", and INA citations were being removed, replaced with a more generic note: ""Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked. SEVIS record has been terminated.""

As of April 9, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that USCIS would now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately.

By April 10, 2025, NAFSA reported receiving over 800 reports of international students and scholars having their visas revoked and/or their SEVIS records terminated. NAFSA also released an initial analysis of these actions.

As of April 11, 2025, Jeff Joseph, incoming president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, stated that the Department of Homeland Security had terminated the records of more than 4,700 international students and scholars in SEVIS since President Donald Trump took office.

As of April 17, 2025  AILA and Senator Durbin's office has identified 4,736 terminations with 4,713 being F-1 and 23 being M-1 students. 

Also around this time, lawsuits began to be filed challenging the SEVIS terminations and visa revocations. For example, a Dartmouth student won a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 9, 2025.


**Reasons for SEVIS Termination:**

The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations. So far the list includes the following:

**Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).""
2. INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the ""serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.
3. INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.

**Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).""

**Notes:**

It is in question as to if SEVP has the authority to terminate a student for a status violation unilaterally without additional processing or appeals. A finding of violation of status due to criminal activity (with few exceptions) requires the student to be removable under specific statutory provisions. Most of which mandate a conviction.

The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in crimes such as burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. However, as of 04/05/2025, a majority of the terminated students identified were not connected to such activities and lacked any convictions. Many of these terminations appear unclear and questionable. As a result, it is strongly advised to promptly apply for reinstatement in most cases, while avoiding travel for visa renewal due to the significant risks associated with reentry.

Regulatory framework imposes restrictions on the termination of an F-1 visa as established in Fang v. ICE, 935 F.3d 172, 185 n.100 (3rd Cir. 2019), the regulations, specifically 8 C.F.R. 214.1(d), do not allow visa termination solely on the basis of a criminal record without additional justification. The termination regulation requires substantial grounds for such actions, as it does not permit termination without more substantial reasoning or justification.

Exceptions to the above would be any crimes involving DUI, drugs, assault, burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, or similar types of crimes. Even a lack of conviction for the above crimes could still leave a student open to status termination and visa revocation.

Initial termination reasons in SEVIS were reportedly changed after-the-fact to ""OTHER"" with more vague notations and removal of INA citations.

**Impact on Students:**      
* Immediate loss of F-1 status.    
* Loss of all on- and off-campus employment authorization, including OPT and CPT.    
* Inability to re-enter the U.S. if they depart.   
* Termination of status for dependents (spouses or children).   
* Potential for accruing unlawful presence.   
* Complications for future visa applications.   
* Distress and uncertainty due to lack of clear explanations and due process.   

**Due Process Concerns and Legal Challenges:**     
* Many terminations appear to occur without adequate notice or explanation, hindering students' ability to defend themselves.     
* Reinstatement of student status is possible through USCIS but is a slow process with uncertain outcomes and requires acknowledging a status violation. Immigration judges cannot review reinstatement denials.    
* Challenging visa revocations has limited due process protections, with the Supreme Court ruling that revocation of a visa petition lacks judicial review.    
* Students facing removal proceedings have the right to legal counsel (at their own expense) and can challenge the government's evidence.           




# **Advice and Recommendations:**

I once tried reading legal documents for fun—turns out, fun was not had. If you're making decisions that could affect your future, your finances, or your freedom, please consult an actual attorney, not someone who thinks ‘voir dire’ is just fancy French for ‘tell the truth’. Trusting me for legal advice would be like trusting a raccoon to draft your will—sure, it might tuck it away safely, but only after chewing the edges and storing it in a tree.""***



**File a TRO and/or join a class of students in filing lawsuits*  
Students are seeing more success going the legal route over reinstatement.

**Reinstatement Process:**  
Students can apply for reinstatement by submitting Form I-539 to USCIS, along with supporting documents and fees. Eligibility requires proving the violation was beyond their control and showing intent to resume full-time study. Do this *WITH* an immigration attorney. ***Do not do this alone.***

* Many of the terminations are mysterious and questionable. Thus, application for reinstatement asap is highly recommended for most. Travel to renew a revoked visa and risk a perilous reentry is not advised currently.
* For reinstatement, a student must assert that no status violation has taken place, claiming that ICE acted unilaterally and without valid justification in terminating the record. In certain instances, the sole removal basis referenced in the SEVIS termination is INA Section 237(a)(1)(C)(i), which requires, with few exceptions, a conviction. Other terminations have no specific reason provided. In these situations, a student can challenge ICE’s claim and emphasize that no conclusive determination of removability has been issued.
* However, there is a very serious potential risk with reinstatement. A denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence towards the 3 and 10-year bans on return to the US in the future. Currently, a SEVIS termination alone does not come with immediate unlawful presence accrual.

**Travel After Termination and re-entry:**  
Not advisable without consultation from an immigration attorney well-versed in SEVP/F/J/M status. Likelihood of a denial is deemed exceptionally high.

**Impact on Future Visa Applications:**  
SEVIS terminations and Visa revocations can complicate future visa applications.

**Options for Staying in the U.S.**:  
Students can apply for reinstatement or leave the U.S. and re-enter with a new SEVIS record (not advised). Remaining in the U.S. without status will lead to complications.

**Appealing SEVIS Termination:**  
Appeals or motions can be filed with SEVP, often requiring Form I-290B and a fee. Legal counsel is recommended for complex cases.

**Grace Periods:**  
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:

* When a reinstatement application is denied
* An immigration judge issues a removal order, or
* Department of Homeland Security identifies a status violation during the review of another immigration benefit.
* F-1 students are admitted for ""Duration of Status"" (D/S), meaning they can remain in the U.S. as long as they comply with the terms of their visa and maintain an active/valid SEVIS record. However, once a violation occurs, such as termination of SEVIS without reinstatement, the protections of D/S may no longer apply.

**Legal Assistance:**  
Immigration attorneys can provide guidance on reinstatement, appeals, or other SEVIS-related issues.

**Social Media:**  
[April 9, 2025 ](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism)The Department of Homeland Security announced that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately.

# FAQ

**Are students getting their visas revoked over traffic tickets?**

*Maybe. But let’s be real—you probably aren't. So calm down. No one here actually knows for sure, except ICE Officer Jerry, who is undoubtedly lurking and enjoying the chaos. And guess what? Jerry’s not talking..*

**Are students being terminated and losing their visas because of their nationality?**

*No. There is no clear pattern or trend in terms of the nationality of the students being affected by the visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations. Students from all regions of the world are being impacted.*


**Are people with no criminal history being terminated?**

There are reported cases where the victim of a crime had their status terminated. It looks to be an error in finding the victim of a crime and running them as the perpetrator of the crime. There have also been US Citizen Immigration Attorneys who have received letters that their admissions to the US is over and they need to depart. So, some stupid mistakes are happening. 

If your status is terminated, talk to an immigration attorney 

**What crimes are students being terminated for?**  
We do not know the specific reasons why students were terminated. We are making our best guesses/assumptions. The government has not released specifics for anyone's case. Until lawsuits are filed and discovery made, we will not know why students were specifically terminated.

Additionally, students terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)

**Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction?**

Yes, it looks like they are doing so. Whether this is legal is questionable, with the source noting ""probably, almost certainly not"". The ""Identity match in criminal records"" is listed as a reason for termination, and reports indicate that a majority of terminated students as of 04/05/2025 were not connected to activities covered by the Laken Riley Act and lacked any convictions. Terminations have cited ""Student identified in criminal records check"" under ""Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status"".


**Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?**

*There is now enough data to say that fingerprinting is strongly correlated to the terminations. Not a guarantee as there are far, far more people with fingerprinting records than terminations*

**Should I go home?**

*See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.*

**Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction**

Looks like they are doing so. Is it legal...probably, almost certainly not.

**Does the policy apply equally to all nonimmigrant visa categories, such as J-1 or H-1B visas?** Currently, the focus appears to be on F-1 student visas and visitor visas, but other categories may also be scrutinized under similar standards.

**What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?**  
Gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.

**Are there any protections for students terminated due to administrative errors?**

Students may argue that no violation occurred and challenge the termination through reinstatement requests or legal processes.

**Can I work if my SEVIS was terminated while on OPT/STEM OPT?**

No.

**Can I work while my reinstatement application is pending?**

No, students cannot legally work while awaiting a decision on their reinstatement application.

**What are the chances of successfully re-entering the U.S. with a new SEVIS record?**

Re-entry with a new SEVIS record is risky and often leads to significant scrutiny or denial at the border.

**If my SEVIS record is terminated, do I have any grace period to leave the U.S.?**  
F-1 students typically do not have a formal grace period after SEVIS termination, unless reinstatement is being pursued or another status is obtained.

**Does unlawful presence begin immediately after SEVIS termination?**

No, it begins only under specific conditions, such as reinstatement denial or a formal determination by DHS.

**What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?**

You should gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.

**Does sealing my record stop me from being at risk?**      
No. Records cannot be sealed for immigration purposes. 

**What types of social media activity might lead to visa revocation or termination?**  
Posts that are perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.

**Can deleting controversial posts prevent issues with immigration authorities?**

While deleting posts may help, authorities could still review archived or previously flagged content.

**Should I deactivate my social media accounts to avoid scrutiny?**

Deactivating accounts may reduce visibility but could also be perceived as an attempt to hide activity, so consult an attorney for guidance.

**How can I find an immigration attorney experienced in SEVIS-related issues?**  
Look for attorneys specializing in student visas and nonimmigrant status cases through trusted organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).

**What should I bring to a consultation with an immigration attorney?**

Bring all relevant documents, including visa information, SEVIS termination notices, emails from ICE or the Department of State, and any supporting evidence for your case.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay on Topic.&lt;/strong&gt; All questions and responses must be directly related to immigration procedures, policies for the recent SEVIS terminations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Judgment or Personal Opinions.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a judgment-free zone. Do not comment on someone’s choices, background, or reasons for termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Speculation.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid guessing or giving advice without clear, verified knowledge. If you&amp;#39;re unsure, do not answer. Any information that is not confirmed or corroborated by AILA, NAFSA, or otherwise publicly posted by law firms specializing in SEVP immigration will be removed. Users will be temporarily banned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cite Official Sources When Possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Use and link to official government or legal sources (e.g., USCIS, IRCC, Home Office) whenever applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Privacy.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not ask for or share personal or identifying information. Respect each other&amp;#39;s confidentiality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Political Debates.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not the place for political arguments or discussions about immigration policy philosophies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Respectful and Courteous.&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain a professional and respectful tone at all times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Off-Topic Comments or Jokes.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep humor, memes, and unrelated commentary out of the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Clear and Complete Questions&lt;/strong&gt; When asking a question, provide relevant details so others can give informed answers (without oversharing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid excessive or repetitive posting&lt;/strong&gt;—do not repeatedly post the same or similar questions to different users. &lt;strong&gt;This will result in a temporary ban.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt; to keep discussions productive and avoid overwhelming conversations, especially if you are not an immigration attorney, Designated School Official (DSO), or similar professional. Focus on providing thoughtful, relevant, and concise contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No questions about your minor traffic infractions.&lt;/strong&gt; No one here can tell you if there will be a problem. Statistically, you are all fine. Even with the highest estimates, less than half a percent of students in the US have been impacted. They are just taking up space here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline of Main Events (Early 2025)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early 2025 (Ongoing): The Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement measures, with a surprising focus on student visas (F-1, M-1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early 2025 (Ongoing): High-profile arrests of international students generate news coverage and raise concerns about First Amendment rights violations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early 2025 (Ongoing): The Department of State (DOS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) aggressively target international students beyond protesters, including those without a history of protest, for visa revocation, termination of their status, and removal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late March 2025: Secretary of State Marco Rubio reports that the DOS revoked more than 300 student visas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late March 2025: Secretary Rubio announces a new program using AI-assisted reviews to screen social media posts of student visa holders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late March 2025 (and ongoing): Hundreds more students have their visas revoked due to alleged criminal activities or criminal cases that were dismissed. These revocations are often based on INA 237(a)(4)(C), citing potential serious adverse foreign policy consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late March 2025 (and ongoing): ICE begins to terminate an unknown number of SEVIS records of international students, impacting their immigration status and employment authorization (including OPT). Terminations are occurring even in cases of minor misdemeanors or dismissed criminal cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 27, 2025: An Axios article quotes a &amp;quot;senior State Department official&amp;quot; warning that institutions with foreign students will undergo review, and having &amp;quot;so many bad apples&amp;quot; could lead to decertification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 28, 2025: Secretary of State Marco Rubio addresses the revocation of over 300 visas (including student and visitor visas), stating that they occur if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests. He clarifies that while many cases are linked to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 31, 2025: NAFSA engages in a conversation with HSI leadership regarding notifications of ICE-initiated SEVIS record terminations, with HSI confirming the expectation that DSOs will notify students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 2025 (Early): Students begin receiving emails from the Department of State notifying them of their F-1 visa revocation under Section 221(i) of the INA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 3, 2025: Attorney Steven Brown posts on X (Twitter) about SEVIS being terminated for minor issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 5, 2025: &lt;a href=""/r/f1visa""&gt;r/f1visa&lt;/a&gt; megathread identifies a majority of the terminated students were not connected to activities covered by the Laken Riley Act (related to certain crimes) and lacked convictions, raising concerns about the basis of terminations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 8, 2025: NAFSA reports that the termination reasons in SEVIS are being changed after-the-fact from specific INA citations to a more generic &amp;quot;OTHER,&amp;quot; with notes like &amp;quot;Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked. SEVIS record has been terminated.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 9, 2025: A Dartmouth student wins a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), allowing them to maintain their status for two weeks while their case continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 11, 2025: Jeff Joseph, incoming president of AILA, reports that more than 4,700 students have had their SEVIS records terminated by DHS since President Trump took office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 11, 2025: Banias Law reports a TRO has been granted in one of their cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 2025 (Ongoing): Several lawsuits are filed by students and legal groups (including SomiReddy Law group, ACLU-NH, and others in CA and PA federal courts) challenging the visa revocations and SEVIS terminations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 2025 (Ongoing): Multiple other TROs have been granted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is currently implementing heightened immigration enforcement measures targeting international students in the U.S. This briefing document synthesizes information from legal and educational association updates, as well as a student-focused online forum, highlighting a significant increase in student visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations. These actions are raising serious concerns regarding due process, First Amendment rights, and potential long-term economic and educational impacts. The Department of State (DOS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are employing new methods, including AI-assisted social media screening, and citing broad grounds like &amp;quot;serious adverse foreign policy consequences&amp;quot; and failure to maintain status, often without clear justification or due process. Over 4,700 students have reportedly had their SEVIS records terminated as of April 11, 2025. Legal challenges are underway, and guidance emphasizes the critical need for affected students to seek immediate legal counsel. Courts across the country are increasingly siding with affected students, granting temporary restraining orders (TROs) en masse to block unjust visa revocations and SEVIS terminations. Judges are recognizing the severe due process violations and lack of transparency in these enforcement actions, with many calling out the Kafkaesque nature of the current system. Students, who have done nothing wrong, are facing sudden status terminations with little to no explanation, forcing legal battles that are now gaining traction. The surge in TROs reflects judicial pushback against arbitrary immigration enforcement, highlighting the urgent need for clearer protections for international students caught in bureaucratic chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event Overview/Summary: Increased SEVIS Terminations and Visa Revocations for International Students (March-April 2025)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On or about March 24, 2025, schools began to observe that F-1 student records were being terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security within the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). These actions directly impacted the legal status of international students in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, students started receiving email notifications from the Department of State (DOS) informing them that their F-1 visas had been revoked. The example wording of these emails stated: &amp;quot;On behalf of the United States Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued. As a result, your F-1 visa was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended&amp;quot;. The revocation authority lies with INA Section 221(i), which grants the Secretary of State discretion to revoke visas at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 28, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the revocation of over 300 visas, clarifying that this number included both student and visitor visas. He stated that visas were being revoked if individuals engaged in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests. While many cases were linked to pro-Palestinian protests, some involved unrelated groups or criminal charges. Rubio explained that if the information about an individual would have prevented their initial visa approval, the visa was being revoked. He also confirmed that this number of revocations was growing daily. The Department of State has been using INA 237(a)(4)(C), which concerns potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences, as a basis for some of these revocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Developments (Late March - Early April 2025):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By late March 2025, Secretary Rubio had reported the revocation of more than 300 student visas.
Concurrently with visa revocations, ICE began to terminate an unknown number of international student records in SEVIS, which has significant implications for their immigration status. These actions were described as unprecedented, with wide-ranging impacts and significant due process concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The termination reasons initially noted in SEVIS often included &amp;quot;OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS&amp;quot;, sometimes in conjunction with INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (general failure to maintain nonimmigrant status) and INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) (serious adverse foreign policy consequences). Another initial termination reason was &amp;quot;OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(I).&amp;quot;. NAFSA began receiving reports of these SEVIS terminations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By April 3, 2025, attorney Steven Brown noted on X that SEVIS records were being terminated for minor issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 4, 2025, NAFSA and other higher education associations signed a letter from the American Council on Education (ACE) to the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, seeking more information on the policies and planned actions concerning international students and scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around April 8, 2025, NAFSA reported that the termination reasons in SEVIS were being changed after-the-fact from &amp;quot;OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;OTHER&amp;quot;, and INA citations were being removed, replaced with a more generic note: &amp;quot;Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked. SEVIS record has been terminated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of April 9, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that USCIS would now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By April 10, 2025, NAFSA reported receiving over 800 reports of international students and scholars having their visas revoked and/or their SEVIS records terminated. NAFSA also released an initial analysis of these actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of April 11, 2025, Jeff Joseph, incoming president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, stated that the Department of Homeland Security had terminated the records of more than 4,700 international students and scholars in SEVIS since President Donald Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of April 17, 2025  AILA and Senator Durbin&amp;#39;s office has identified 4,736 terminations with 4,713 being F-1 and 23 being M-1 students. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also around this time, lawsuits began to be filed challenging the SEVIS terminations and visa revocations. For example, a Dartmouth student won a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 9, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for SEVIS Termination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations. So far the list includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the &amp;quot;serious adverse foreign policy consequences&amp;quot; provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in question as to if SEVP has the authority to terminate a student for a status violation unilaterally without additional processing or appeals. A finding of violation of status due to criminal activity (with few exceptions) requires the student to be removable under specific statutory provisions. Most of which mandate a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in crimes such as burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. However, as of 04/05/2025, a majority of the terminated students identified were not connected to such activities and lacked any convictions. Many of these terminations appear unclear and questionable. As a result, it is strongly advised to promptly apply for reinstatement in most cases, while avoiding travel for visa renewal due to the significant risks associated with reentry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory framework imposes restrictions on the termination of an F-1 visa as established in Fang v. ICE, 935 F.3d 172, 185 n.100 (3rd Cir. 2019), the regulations, specifically 8 C.F.R. 214.1(d), do not allow visa termination solely on the basis of a criminal record without additional justification. The termination regulation requires substantial grounds for such actions, as it does not permit termination without more substantial reasoning or justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions to the above would be any crimes involving DUI, drugs, assault, burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, or similar types of crimes. Even a lack of conviction for the above crimes could still leave a student open to status termination and visa revocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial termination reasons in SEVIS were reportedly changed after-the-fact to &amp;quot;OTHER&amp;quot; with more vague notations and removal of INA citations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Students:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* Immediate loss of F-1 status.&lt;br/&gt;
* Loss of all on- and off-campus employment authorization, including OPT and CPT.&lt;br/&gt;
* Inability to re-enter the U.S. if they depart.&lt;br/&gt;
* Termination of status for dependents (spouses or children).&lt;br/&gt;
* Potential for accruing unlawful presence.&lt;br/&gt;
* Complications for future visa applications.&lt;br/&gt;
* Distress and uncertainty due to lack of clear explanations and due process.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due Process Concerns and Legal Challenges:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* Many terminations appear to occur without adequate notice or explanation, hindering students&amp;#39; ability to defend themselves.&lt;br/&gt;
* Reinstatement of student status is possible through USCIS but is a slow process with uncertain outcomes and requires acknowledging a status violation. Immigration judges cannot review reinstatement denials.&lt;br/&gt;
* Challenging visa revocations has limited due process protections, with the Supreme Court ruling that revocation of a visa petition lacks judicial review.&lt;br/&gt;
* Students facing removal proceedings have the right to legal counsel (at their own expense) and can challenge the government&amp;#39;s evidence.           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice and Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot; Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, nor do I moonlight as one in an alternate timeline where I deliver stirring courtroom speeches on primetime TV. I once tried reading legal documents for fun—turns out, fun was not had. If you&amp;#39;re making decisions that could affect your future, your finances, or your freedom, please consult an actual attorney, not someone who thinks ‘voir dire’ is just fancy French for ‘tell the truth’. Trusting me for legal advice would be like trusting a raccoon to draft your will—sure, it might tuck it away safely, but only after chewing the edges and storing it in a tree.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;File a TRO and/or join a class of students in filing lawsuits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Students are seeing more success going the legal route over reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinstatement Process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Students can apply for reinstatement by submitting Form I-539 to USCIS, along with supporting documents and fees. Eligibility requires proving the violation was beyond their control and showing intent to resume full-time study. Do this &lt;em&gt;WITH&lt;/em&gt; an immigration attorney. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not do this alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the terminations are mysterious and questionable. Thus, application for reinstatement asap is highly recommended for most. Travel to renew a revoked visa and risk a perilous reentry is not advised currently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For reinstatement, a student must assert that no status violation has taken place, claiming that ICE acted unilaterally and without valid justification in terminating the record. In certain instances, the sole removal basis referenced in the SEVIS termination is INA Section 237(a)(1)(C)(i), which requires, with few exceptions, a conviction. Other terminations have no specific reason provided. In these situations, a student can challenge ICE’s claim and emphasize that no conclusive determination of removability has been issued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, there is a very serious potential risk with reinstatement. A denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence towards the 3 and 10-year bans on return to the US in the future. Currently, a SEVIS termination alone does not come with immediate unlawful presence accrual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel After Termination and re-entry:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Not advisable without consultation from an immigration attorney well-versed in SEVP/F/J/M status. Likelihood of a denial is deemed exceptionally high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Future Visa Applications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
SEVIS terminations and Visa revocations can complicate future visa applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Options for Staying in the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;
Students can apply for reinstatement or leave the U.S. and re-enter with a new SEVIS record (not advised). Remaining in the U.S. without status will lead to complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appealing SEVIS Termination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Appeals or motions can be filed with SEVP, often requiring Form I-290B and a fee. Legal counsel is recommended for complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace Periods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a reinstatement application is denied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An immigration judge issues a removal order, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department of Homeland Security identifies a status violation during the review of another immigration benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-1 students are admitted for &amp;quot;Duration of Status&amp;quot; (D/S), meaning they can remain in the U.S. as long as they comply with the terms of their visa and maintain an active/valid SEVIS record. However, once a violation occurs, such as termination of SEVIS without reinstatement, the protections of D/S may no longer apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal Assistance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Immigration attorneys can provide guidance on reinstatement, appeals, or other SEVIS-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=""https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism""&gt;April 9, 2025 &lt;/a&gt;The Department of Homeland Security announced that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students getting their visas revoked over traffic tickets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe. But let’s be real—you probably aren&amp;#39;t. So calm down. No one here actually knows for sure, except ICE Officer Jerry, who is undoubtedly lurking and enjoying the chaos. And guess what? Jerry’s not talking..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because of their nationality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. There is no clear pattern or trend in terms of the nationality of the students being affected by the visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations. Students from all regions of the world are being impacted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are people with no criminal history being terminated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reported cases where the victim of a crime had their status terminated. It looks to be an error in finding the victim of a crime and running them as the perpetrator of the crime. There have also been US Citizen Immigration Attorneys who have received letters that their admissions to the US is over and they need to depart. So, some stupid mistakes are happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your status is terminated, talk to an immigration attorney &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What crimes are students being terminated for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We do not know the specific reasons why students were terminated. We are making our best guesses/assumptions. The government has not released specifics for anyone&amp;#39;s case. Until lawsuits are filed and discovery made, we will not know why students were specifically terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, students terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it looks like they are doing so. Whether this is legal is questionable, with the source noting &amp;quot;probably, almost certainly not&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Identity match in criminal records&amp;quot; is listed as a reason for termination, and reports indicate that a majority of terminated students as of 04/05/2025 were not connected to activities covered by the Laken Riley Act and lacked any convictions. Terminations have cited &amp;quot;Student identified in criminal records check&amp;quot; under &amp;quot;Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is now enough data to say that fingerprinting is strongly correlated to the terminations. Not a guarantee as there are far, far more people with fingerprinting records than terminations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I go home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like they are doing so. Is it legal...probably, almost certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the policy apply equally to all nonimmigrant visa categories, such as J-1 or H-1B visas?&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, the focus appears to be on F-1 student visas and visitor visas, but other categories may also be scrutinized under similar standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any protections for students terminated due to administrative errors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students may argue that no violation occurred and challenge the termination through reinstatement requests or legal processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I work if my SEVIS was terminated while on OPT/STEM OPT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I work while my reinstatement application is pending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, students cannot legally work while awaiting a decision on their reinstatement application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the chances of successfully re-entering the U.S. with a new SEVIS record?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-entry with a new SEVIS record is risky and often leads to significant scrutiny or denial at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If my SEVIS record is terminated, do I have any grace period to leave the U.S.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
F-1 students typically do not have a formal grace period after SEVIS termination, unless reinstatement is being pursued or another status is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does unlawful presence begin immediately after SEVIS termination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it begins only under specific conditions, such as reinstatement denial or a formal determination by DHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does sealing my record stop me from being at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
No. Records cannot be sealed for immigration purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What types of social media activity might lead to visa revocation or termination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Posts that are perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can deleting controversial posts prevent issues with immigration authorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While deleting posts may help, authorities could still review archived or previously flagged content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I deactivate my social media accounts to avoid scrutiny?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deactivating accounts may reduce visibility but could also be perceived as an attempt to hide activity, so consult an attorney for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I find an immigration attorney experienced in SEVIS-related issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Look for attorneys specializing in student visas and nonimmigrant status cases through trusted organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I bring to a consultation with an immigration attorney?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring all relevant documents, including visa information, SEVIS termination notices, emails from ICE or the Department of State, and any supporting evidence for your case.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m an F1 OPT student graduating this May 2025 and currently living in Chicago. My wisdom tooth pain just started and I urgently need dental care.
The issue is—my student insurance is ending this semester and doesn’t include dental coverage.

Does anyone know any low-cost or emergency dental clinics in Chicago?
Are there any community programs or dental schools that help international students?
Any advice or suggestions would be really appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

I am writing this post in case anyone reading this is on the same/similar boat and hopefully my experience will encourage them how other posts in this thread helped me prepare for my interview. 

**Previous stay in US and Visa status:** 

I entered US first time in Jan 2013 on F1 visa. I had \~5 years of work experience in India, had decent GRE and TOEFL score and my visa interview that time was pretty easy as my motive to go to US was to attain masters degree with speciality in cloud and distributed systems. 

I completed my masters in May 2014 and got and opportunity with a US firm. I joined the firm  on F1-OPT status. After few months this firm filed for my H1 in 2015 where luckily my  case was selected and approved and I moved to H1 status from F1-OPT in Sep 2015. 

While working on H1 I changed my job couple of times and was also offered to apply for GC which I opted for and got my I-140 approved in 2019. 



**Move back to home country:**

In middle of 2022, I had to fly to my home country for more than couple of months for a personal reason , as everyone was working remotely, my firm allowed me to work from my home country for and extended period (&gt;1 months but &lt;4 months). Unfortunately I was impacted by mass layoff at my firm and lost my job and  thus H1 status as well. 



**Decision to reapply for F1:**

I tried to find a new role in US form my home country for few months, but veined off looking at the market situation. I later on found a role in my home country where I worked for a year and then quit to start with something of my own. 

The new venture I am looking to hop into requires me to reskin myself in AI and after few months of procrastination I chose to go back to US on F1 to do another masters with speciality in AI. 

I was told by many friends that my visa wont be approved as I already have a masters from US , worked on H1 for 7 years and then also have an approved I-140, but I tried anyways and guess what (spoiler) my visa was approved with acceptance letter from only one University. 



**Visa Interview Experience:** 

Visa center : New Delhi (both OFC and Interview)

Outcome: approved.

I got an early visa slot not by option , but as that was the only one available and here how my conversation with the visa officer (VO) went:

VO: Good Morning (While I was walking towards the window)

Me: Good Morning 

VO: Pass me you I20 and passport

Me: (Complied)

VO: Oh! You want to go to XYZ university for your master, any specific reason for choosing this university?

Me: Yes, I have applied for this masters as I want to re-skill myself in AI specifically for business application in emerging markets. I am planning to start a business {with XYZ plan and XYZ outcome} and in order to innovate in this area I neeD to leverage AI specifically how it can be utilized in my use case.

VO: how many universities did you apply for?

Me: 3, but I received and early offer letter from my first choice so I discontinued application process from one and withdrew application from another  .. {I had 1-2 more lines articulated in my mind to explain my decision, but I was interrupted by VO while he was focused on his computer screen}. 

VO: You already have a masters?

Me: Yes. I completed my masters from XYZ university in US in 2014. 

VO You also worked in the US on H1? {VO starts flipping my passport page to find my previous Visa stamping (guessing)}

Me: Yes. I worked in US on H1 from 2015 to 2022. 

VO: And you want to go for another masters now?

Me: Yes. AI and ML has taken over the industry and from my previous experience I know how quick things move in tech. I need to leverage the time I have. 

VO: {Nodding his head} when did you come back from US

Me: July 2022

VO: {Typing something and focused on his screen} can you give me a minute please. 

{VO goes to someone else and discusses something for about a minute and comes back.}

VO: Remind me when did you come back ?

Me: {A little nervous and also frankly a little taken back by the repetitive question answered with a dull tone) July 2022. 

VO: please don’t mind. It’s early and my brain Is not braining right now (starts typing something again)

Me: {giggled and started preparing to receive a rejection as the two people before me were also F1 applicant and they were declined after a little bit of conundrum in their case.}

VO: Place your right four rings on the scanner. 

Me: {Trying to comply}

VO: Congrats, your visa has been issued. You can collect your passport from VFS center in 7 days (yes, “ISSUED” thats what he said not sure if it’s common or not)

Me: {Visibly shaken as I was all prepared to fail} Thank you!

  
I came out of the embassy confused and I remember trying to recollect my conversation with the VO few times to check if I heard the decision incorrectly and I have left my passport on the counter. It wasn’t until I was completely out of the embassy building when I realised that my visa has been approved and I started smiling. 

I am writing this part not to boast, but to make a point on not to form a prejudice about your situation and hurt your chances. In my case I was lucky that I had previous US visa and technically I had already once moved back from US to my home country (in my opinion this is what helped me get approved), but if that was not the case I had shot myself on the foot by pre-determining what decision entailed the interview and made myself nervous for no reason. I highly recommend applicant to use others interview experiences to prepare yourself for the process and not gauge if your case has a better chance or not.

I think the best way to prepare for the visa interview is to have a solid unambiguous intent which will lead to a honest conversation with the VO. IMO VO can easily identify a recited answer which creates a negative perception of the applicant. 

Sorry for the long post , but I really hope my case and visa experience helps someone in need.

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post , but I really hope my case and visa experience helps someone in need. &lt;/p&gt;

**PSA for students and job seekers in AI/tech — beware of a suspicious group called ""Reality AI Lab"" (previously known as Radical AI).**

I wanted to raise some concerns about what appears to be a pay-to-play internship scam operating under the new name *Reality AI Lab*. If you’re a student or early-career dev looking for experience in AI or software, this is something to be aware of before getting involved.

# What’s going on?

They present themselves as an open-source AI lab or internship-like opportunity. At first glance, it seems legit—collaborative, team-based, and focused on AI projects. But the catch is this: to actually receive a formal offer letter or be included in their so-called “Pro” team, they ask you to **pay** for a membership.

This isn’t just a one-off incident—it’s baked into their model. There are multiple reports of people being invited to “join the team” only to later be told they need to pay to receive documentation or recognition. That’s not how internships work—especially unpaid ones.

# Major red flags:

**1. Charging for Offer Letters / Recognition**  
They frame it like a competitive internship or contributor program. But then, if you want formal proof you were involved, they suddenly require a membership fee. Sometimes they even offer discounts (50–75%) if you hesitate, just to extract *something*. That’s not standard or ethical practice.

**2. Leadership Shuffle**  
One individual who was a self-described 3-month intern is now suddenly listed as CEO on LinkedIn. Meanwhile, internal docs and older pages mention different people—like Talha Sabri, Michael Berliner, and Yonus Jamal—as being in charge. It’s not clear who actually runs the org.

**3. Rebranding History**  
They were previously called *Radical AI*. After online criticism started surfacing, the name was changed to *Reality AI Lab*, and their social presence was scrubbed. For example, their LinkedIn now shows no activity before a few months ago. It looks like a deliberate reset to avoid accountability.

**4. Dubious Monetization Strategy**  
Screenshots from internal planning docs show objectives like “$60,000/month from Pro Team memberships.” Their focus seems less on mentorship or education and more on monetizing students by selling access and recognition.

**5. Serious Legal/Ethical Concerns for International Students**  
International students often need proper work authorization for internships or volunteer work. Encouraging them to pay for unpaid “offers” could seriously jeopardize their visa status. That’s a massive red flag.

# How the “Pro Team” scam plays out:

* You’re invited to contribute or apply for a role.
* After some involvement, you ask for an offer letter or something formal.
* You’re told you need to join the “Pro Team”—but it costs money.
* If you’re unsure, they’ll often drop the price significantly to still get a payment out of you.

Again—**no legitimate company or internship should ask for money to give you an offer letter** or let you participate in an open-source team. That’s simply not how this industry works.

# Want to see proof?

Someone compiled documentation and screenshots here. It includes excerpts from internal chats, payment requests, and rebranding evidence.  
Here’s the link (formatting it this way to avoid spam filters):

(Replace `[dot]` with `.` to access it.)

If you’re a student, especially if you're on a visa, **please be cautious**. There are a lot of great learning opportunities out there—but if someone’s asking for cash to “let” you intern or provide a letter, it’s a scam. Always vet the org, look up its history, and trust your instincts if something feels off.

# Rules: This topic and post will be heavily moderated.

1. **Stay on Topic.** All questions and responses must be directly related to immigration procedures, policies for the recent SEVIS terminations.
2. **No Judgment or Personal Opinions.** This is a judgment-free zone. Do not comment on someone’s choices, background, or reasons for termination.
3. **No Speculation.** Avoid guessing or giving advice without clear, verified knowledge. If you're unsure, do not answer. Any information that is not confirmed or corroborated by AILA, NAFSA, or otherwise publicly posted by law firms specializing in SEVP immigration will be removed. Users will be temporarily banned.
4. **Cite Official Sources When Possible.** Use and link to official government or legal sources (e.g., USCIS, IRCC, Home Office) whenever applicable.
5. **Respect Privacy.** Do not ask for or share personal or identifying information. Respect each other's confidentiality.
6. **No Political Debates.** This is not the place for political arguments or discussions about immigration policy philosophies.
7. **Be Respectful and Courteous.** Maintain a professional and respectful tone at all times.
8. **No Off-Topic Comments or Jokes.** Keep humor, memes, and unrelated commentary out of the discussion.
9. **Use Clear and Complete Questions** When asking a question, provide relevant details so others can give informed answers (without oversharing).
10. **Avoid excessive or repetitive posting**—do not repeatedly post the same or similar questions to different users. **This will result in a temporary ban.**
11. **Limit follow-up questions** to keep discussions productive and avoid overwhelming conversations, especially if you are not an immigration attorney, Designated School Official (DSO), or similar professional. Focus on providing thoughtful, relevant, and concise contributions.

# What we know as of April 11, 2025

**Reports of Terminations:**

* On or about March 24, 2025, schools started to notice F-1 students were terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). These terminations affect international students, impacting their legal status in the United States.
* Around the same time, students started to receive emails from the Department of State notifying the student at the email associated with their most recent F-1 visa application that their visa was revoked. Example word below:
   * *""On behalf of the United States Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued.  As a result, your F-1 visa was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. ""*
* On March 28, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the revocation of over 300 visas, clarifying that these include both student and visitor visas. He emphasized that visas are revoked if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests. While many cases are linked to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges. Rubio explained his standard for revocation: if the information about an individual would have prevented their visa approval initially, the visa is revoked. This number is growing as the 300 reference was the number given a few days prior and Rubio confirmed more were happening each day.

**Reasons for SEVIS Termination:**

The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations. So far the list includes the following:

**Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).""
2. INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the ""serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.
3. INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.

**Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).""

**Notes:**

It is in question as to if SEVP has the authority to terminate a student for a status violation unilaterally without additional processing or appeals. A finding of violation of status due to criminal activity (with few exceptions) requires the student to be removable under specific statutory provisions. Most of which mandate a conviction.

The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in crimes such as burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. However, as of 04/05/2025, a majority of the terminated students identified were not connected to such activities and lacked any convictions. Many of these terminations appear unclear and questionable. As a result, it is strongly advised to promptly apply for reinstatement in most cases, while avoiding travel for visa renewal due to the significant risks associated with reentry.

Regulatory framework imposes restrictions on the termination of an F-1 visa as established in Fang v. ICE, 935 F.3d 172, 185 n.100 (3rd Cir. 2019), the regulations, specifically 8 C.F.R. 214.1(d), do not allow visa termination solely on the basis of a criminal record without additional justification. The termination regulation requires substantial grounds for such actions, as it does not permit termination without more substantial reasoning or justification.

Exceptions to the above would be any crimes involving DUI, drugs, assault, burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, or similar types of crimes. Even a lack of conviction for the above crimes could still leave a student open to status termination and visa revocation.

# Advice

***""Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, nor do I moonlight as one in a parallel universe. In fact, I’m just your friendly neighborhood chaos coordinator. If you’re making life-altering decisions, please talk to an actual immigration attorney—not not a quirky coordinator who thrives on puns and internet trivia. Trusting me for legal advice would be like trusting your cat to file your taxes—it’s adorable, but it’s probably not going to end well!""***

**Reinstatement Process:**  
Students can apply for reinstatement by submitting Form I-539 to USCIS, along with supporting documents and fees. Eligibility requires proving the violation was beyond their control and showing intent to resume full-time study. Do this *WITH* an immigration attorney. ***Do not do this alone.***

* Many of the terminations are mysterious and questionable. Thus, application for reinstatement asap is highly recommended for most. Travel to renew a revoked visa and risk a perilous reentry is not advised currently.
* For reinstatement, a student must assert that no status violation has taken place, claiming that ICE acted unilaterally and without valid justification in terminating the record. In certain instances, the sole removal basis referenced in the SEVIS termination is INA Section 237(a)(1)(C)(i), which requires, with few exceptions, a conviction. Other terminations have no specific reason provided. In these situations, a student can challenge ICE’s claim and emphasize that no conclusive determination of removability has been issued.
* However, there is a very serious potential risk with reinstatement. A denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence towards the 3 and 10-year bans on return to the US in the future. Currently, a SEVIS termination alone does not come with immediate unlawful presence accrual.

**Travel After Termination and re-entry:**  
Not advisable without consultation from an immigration attorney well-versed in SEVP/F/J/M status. Likelihood of a denial is deemed exceptionally high.

**Impact on Future Visa Applications:**  
SEVIS terminations and Visa revocations can complicate future visa applications.

**Options for Staying in the U.S.**:  
Students can apply for reinstatement or leave the U.S. and re-enter with a new SEVIS record (not advised). Remaining in the U.S. without status will lead to complications.

**Appealing SEVIS Termination:**  
Appeals or motions can be filed with SEVP, often requiring Form I-290B and a fee. Legal counsel is recommended for complex cases.

**Grace Periods:**  
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:

* When a reinstatement application is denied
* An immigration judge issues a removal order, or
* Department of Homeland Security identifies a status violation during the review of another immigration benefit.
* F-1 students are admitted for ""Duration of Status"" (D/S), meaning they can remain in the U.S. as long as they comply with the terms of their visa and maintain an active/valid SEVIS record. However, once a violation occurs, such as termination of SEVIS without reinstatement, the protections of D/S may no longer apply.

**Legal Assistance:**  
Immigration attorneys can provide guidance on reinstatement, appeals, or other SEVIS-related issues.

**Social Media:**  
[April 9, 2025 ](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism)The Department of Homeland Security announced that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately.

* Use strict privacy settings to limit visibility of personal posts..
* Even unintentional or past posts could be scrutinized under this policy.
* Be mindful of your affiliations, both online and offline.
* Consult with an immigration attorney if you have concerns about your social media activity

# FAQ

**Are students being terminated and losing their visas because of their nationality?**

*No*

**Are students being terminated and losing their visas over speeding tickets?**

*Possibly. If you were fingerprinted in connection then it is possible, but still highly unlikely at this time.*

**Are students being terminated and losing their visas over minor infractions?**

*No.* If your criminal action was a high-level crime or serious offense involving drugs, fraud, theft, or violence, then you are at risk of termination.

**Are people with misdemeanor or even speeding tickets getting revoked?**

Yes. but not in significant numbers. The high majority of those we reviewed we could identify more serious items.

**Are people with no criminal history being terminated?**

There are a few, but again. not in significant numbers. More likely it is an error in the system and represents a small number of overall cases.

There are reported cases where the victim of a crime had their status terminated. There have also been US Citizen Immigration Attorneys who have received letters that their admissions to the US is over and they need to depart. So, some stupid mistakea are happening. 

If your status is terminated, talk to an immigration attorney 

**What crimes are students being terminated for?**  
We do not know the specific reasons why students were terminated. We are making our best guesses/assumptions. The government has not released specifics for anyone's case. Until lawsuits are put through we will not know why students were specifically terminated.

Additionally, student's terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)

**Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?**

\*There is now enough data to say that fingerprinting is strongly correlated to the terminations. Not a guarantee as there are far, far more people with fingerprinting records than terminations \*

**Should I go home?**

*See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.*

***Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction***\*?\*

Looks like they are doing so. Is it legal...probably, almost certainly not.

**Does the policy apply equally to all nonimmigrant visa categories, such as J-1 or H-1B visas?** Currently, the focus appears to be on F-1 student visas and visitor visas, but other categories may also be scrutinized under similar standards.

**What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?**  
Gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.

**Are there any protections for students terminated due to administrative errors?**

Students may argue that no violation occurred and challenge the termination through reinstatement requests or legal processes.

**Can I work if my SEVIS was terminated while on OPT/STEM OPT?**

No.

**Can I work while my reinstatement application is pending?**

No, students cannot legally work while awaiting a decision on their reinstatement application.

**What are the chances of successfully re-entering the U.S. with a new SEVIS record?**

Re-entry with a new SEVIS record is risky and often leads to significant scrutiny or denial at the border.

**If my SEVIS record is terminated, do I have any grace period to leave the U.S.?**  
F-1 students typically do not have a formal grace period after SEVIS termination, unless reinstatement is being pursued or another status is obtained.

**Does unlawful presence begin immediately after SEVIS termination?**

No, it begins only under specific conditions, such as reinstatement denial or a formal determination by DHS.

**Does sealing my record stop me from being at risk?**      
No. Records cannot be sealed for immigration purposes. 

**What types of social media activity might lead to visa revocation or termination?**  
Posts that are perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.

**Can deleting controversial posts prevent issues with immigration authorities?**

While deleting posts may help, authorities could still review archived or previously flagged content.

**Should I deactivate my social media accounts to avoid scrutiny?**

Deactivating accounts may reduce visibility but could also be perceived as an attempt to hide activity, so consult an attorney for guidance.

**How can I find an immigration attorney experienced in SEVIS-related issues?**  
Look for attorneys specializing in student visas and nonimmigrant status cases through trusted organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).

**What should I bring to a consultation with an immigration attorney?**

Bring all relevant documents, including visa information, SEVIS termination notices, emails from ICE or the Department of State, and any supporting evidence for your case.

&lt;h1&gt;Rules: This topic and post will be heavily moderated.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay on Topic.&lt;/strong&gt; All questions and responses must be directly related to immigration procedures, policies for the recent SEVIS terminations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Judgment or Personal Opinions.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a judgment-free zone. Do not comment on someone’s choices, background, or reasons for termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Speculation.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid guessing or giving advice without clear, verified knowledge. If you&amp;#39;re unsure, do not answer. Any information that is not confirmed or corroborated by AILA, NAFSA, or otherwise publicly posted by law firms specializing in SEVP immigration will be removed. Users will be temporarily banned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cite Official Sources When Possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Use and link to official government or legal sources (e.g., USCIS, IRCC, Home Office) whenever applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Privacy.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not ask for or share personal or identifying information. Respect each other&amp;#39;s confidentiality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Political Debates.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not the place for political arguments or discussions about immigration policy philosophies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Respectful and Courteous.&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain a professional and respectful tone at all times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Off-Topic Comments or Jokes.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep humor, memes, and unrelated commentary out of the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Clear and Complete Questions&lt;/strong&gt; When asking a question, provide relevant details so others can give informed answers (without oversharing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid excessive or repetitive posting&lt;/strong&gt;—do not repeatedly post the same or similar questions to different users. &lt;strong&gt;This will result in a temporary ban.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit follow-up questions&lt;/strong&gt; to keep discussions productive and avoid overwhelming conversations, especially if you are not an immigration attorney, Designated School Official (DSO), or similar professional. Focus on providing thoughtful, relevant, and concise contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What we know as of April 11, 2025&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reports of Terminations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On or about March 24, 2025, schools started to notice F-1 students were terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). These terminations affect international students, impacting their legal status in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around the same time, students started to receive emails from the Department of State notifying the student at the email associated with their most recent F-1 visa application that their visa was revoked. Example word below:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;On behalf of the United States Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued.  As a result, your F-1 visa was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On March 28, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the revocation of over 300 visas, clarifying that these include both student and visitor visas. He emphasized that visas are revoked if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests. While many cases are linked to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges. Rubio explained his standard for revocation: if the information about an individual would have prevented their visa approval initially, the visa is revoked. This number is growing as the 300 reference was the number given a few days prior and Rubio confirmed more were happening each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for SEVIS Termination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations. So far the list includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the &amp;quot;serious adverse foreign policy consequences&amp;quot; provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in question as to if SEVP has the authority to terminate a student for a status violation unilaterally without additional processing or appeals. A finding of violation of status due to criminal activity (with few exceptions) requires the student to be removable under specific statutory provisions. Most of which mandate a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in crimes such as burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. However, as of 04/05/2025, a majority of the terminated students identified were not connected to such activities and lacked any convictions. Many of these terminations appear unclear and questionable. As a result, it is strongly advised to promptly apply for reinstatement in most cases, while avoiding travel for visa renewal due to the significant risks associated with reentry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory framework imposes restrictions on the termination of an F-1 visa as established in Fang v. ICE, 935 F.3d 172, 185 n.100 (3rd Cir. 2019), the regulations, specifically 8 C.F.R. 214.1(d), do not allow visa termination solely on the basis of a criminal record without additional justification. The termination regulation requires substantial grounds for such actions, as it does not permit termination without more substantial reasoning or justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions to the above would be any crimes involving DUI, drugs, assault, burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, or similar types of crimes. Even a lack of conviction for the above crimes could still leave a student open to status termination and visa revocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Advice&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, nor do I moonlight as one in a parallel universe. In fact, I’m just your friendly neighborhood chaos coordinator. If you’re making life-altering decisions, please talk to an actual immigration attorney—not not a quirky coordinator who thrives on puns and internet trivia. Trusting me for legal advice would be like trusting your cat to file your taxes—it’s adorable, but it’s probably not going to end well!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinstatement Process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Students can apply for reinstatement by submitting Form I-539 to USCIS, along with supporting documents and fees. Eligibility requires proving the violation was beyond their control and showing intent to resume full-time study. Do this &lt;em&gt;WITH&lt;/em&gt; an immigration attorney. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not do this alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the terminations are mysterious and questionable. Thus, application for reinstatement asap is highly recommended for most. Travel to renew a revoked visa and risk a perilous reentry is not advised currently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For reinstatement, a student must assert that no status violation has taken place, claiming that ICE acted unilaterally and without valid justification in terminating the record. In certain instances, the sole removal basis referenced in the SEVIS termination is INA Section 237(a)(1)(C)(i), which requires, with few exceptions, a conviction. Other terminations have no specific reason provided. In these situations, a student can challenge ICE’s claim and emphasize that no conclusive determination of removability has been issued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, there is a very serious potential risk with reinstatement. A denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence towards the 3 and 10-year bans on return to the US in the future. Currently, a SEVIS termination alone does not come with immediate unlawful presence accrual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel After Termination and re-entry:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Not advisable without consultation from an immigration attorney well-versed in SEVP/F/J/M status. Likelihood of a denial is deemed exceptionally high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Future Visa Applications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
SEVIS terminations and Visa revocations can complicate future visa applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Options for Staying in the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;
Students can apply for reinstatement or leave the U.S. and re-enter with a new SEVIS record (not advised). Remaining in the U.S. without status will lead to complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appealing SEVIS Termination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Appeals or motions can be filed with SEVP, often requiring Form I-290B and a fee. Legal counsel is recommended for complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace Periods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a reinstatement application is denied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An immigration judge issues a removal order, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department of Homeland Security identifies a status violation during the review of another immigration benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-1 students are admitted for &amp;quot;Duration of Status&amp;quot; (D/S), meaning they can remain in the U.S. as long as they comply with the terms of their visa and maintain an active/valid SEVIS record. However, once a violation occurs, such as termination of SEVIS without reinstatement, the protections of D/S may no longer apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal Assistance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Immigration attorneys can provide guidance on reinstatement, appeals, or other SEVIS-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=""https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism""&gt;April 9, 2025 &lt;/a&gt;The Department of Homeland Security announced that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will now consider politically sensitive activity, including social media content and any form of harassment, as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because of their nationality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas over speeding tickets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possibly. If you were fingerprinted in connection then it is possible, but still highly unlikely at this time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas over minor infractions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt; If your criminal action was a high-level crime or serious offense involving drugs, fraud, theft, or violence, then you are at risk of termination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are people with misdemeanor or even speeding tickets getting revoked?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. but not in significant numbers. The high majority of those we reviewed we could identify more serious items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are people with no criminal history being terminated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few, but again. not in significant numbers. More likely it is an error in the system and represents a small number of overall cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reported cases where the victim of a crime had their status terminated. There have also been US Citizen Immigration Attorneys who have received letters that their admissions to the US is over and they need to depart. So, some stupid mistakea are happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your status is terminated, talk to an immigration attorney &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What crimes are students being terminated for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We do not know the specific reasons why students were terminated. We are making our best guesses/assumptions. The government has not released specifics for anyone&amp;#39;s case. Until lawsuits are put through we will not know why students were specifically terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, student&amp;#39;s terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*There is now enough data to say that fingerprinting is strongly correlated to the terminations. Not a guarantee as there are far, far more people with fingerprinting records than terminations *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I go home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can SEVP terminate students without a conviction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*?*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like they are doing so. Is it legal...probably, almost certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the policy apply equally to all nonimmigrant visa categories, such as J-1 or H-1B visas?&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, the focus appears to be on F-1 student visas and visitor visas, but other categories may also be scrutinized under similar standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I do if I believe my SEVIS termination or visa revocation was a mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Gather all relevant documentation and consult an immigration attorney to file for reinstatement or appeal the decision with SEVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any protections for students terminated due to administrative errors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students may argue that no violation occurred and challenge the termination through reinstatement requests or legal processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I work if my SEVIS was terminated while on OPT/STEM OPT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I work while my reinstatement application is pending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, students cannot legally work while awaiting a decision on their reinstatement application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the chances of successfully re-entering the U.S. with a new SEVIS record?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-entry with a new SEVIS record is risky and often leads to significant scrutiny or denial at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If my SEVIS record is terminated, do I have any grace period to leave the U.S.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
F-1 students typically do not have a formal grace period after SEVIS termination, unless reinstatement is being pursued or another status is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does unlawful presence begin immediately after SEVIS termination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it begins only under specific conditions, such as reinstatement denial or a formal determination by DHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does sealing my record stop me from being at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
No. Records cannot be sealed for immigration purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What types of social media activity might lead to visa revocation or termination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Posts that are perceived as politically sensitive, controversial, or critical of U.S. foreign policy, even unintentionally, may lead to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can deleting controversial posts prevent issues with immigration authorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While deleting posts may help, authorities could still review archived or previously flagged content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I deactivate my social media accounts to avoid scrutiny?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deactivating accounts may reduce visibility but could also be perceived as an attempt to hide activity, so consult an attorney for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I find an immigration attorney experienced in SEVIS-related issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Look for attorneys specializing in student visas and nonimmigrant status cases through trusted organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I bring to a consultation with an immigration attorney?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring all relevant documents, including visa information, SEVIS termination notices, emails from ICE or the Department of State, and any supporting evidence for your case.&lt;/p&gt;

1jx3td1,Need Advice: F-1 OPT – Reaching End of Unemployment Period &amp; Confused by Employer Rejection,gleeabooo,16,0,16,0.81,10,1744414405,2025-04-11T23:33:25.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/1jx3td1/need_advice_f1_opt_reaching_end_of_unemployment/,https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/1jx3td1/need_advice_f1_opt_reaching_end_of_unemployment/,"Hey everyone,

I’m an international student currently on F-1 OPT, and I’m down to my last 30 days of unemployment. I’ve been grinding applications for months — getting ghosted, rejected, and moving forward in some. Recently, I finally made it to the end of a multi-round interview process with a company I was really excited about, and while the team wanted to move forward, HR said they *don’t sponsor entry-level roles.*

Here’s the part I’m struggling with — **I don’t need sponsorship** right now, and I tried to explain that. I’d love any insight or advice.

# What happened:

The process had 4 rounds:

1. HR screening (asked if I needed future sponsorship – I said no)
2. Technical casing
3. Hiring manager
4. Final HR call (asked if I had permanent work authorization – I said no)

I think there’s a misunderstanding between “sponsorship” and “work authorization,” so here’s how I tried to explain my situation:

# 1. F-1 OPT (12-Month Work Authorization – No Sponsorship Required)

I’m on F-1 OPT, have received my EAD, and am authorized to work full-time through February 10, 2026.

**What the employer needs to do:**  
✅ Just complete the I-9 using my EAD card.  
❌ No immigration filing or legal obligations.

# 2. STEM OPT Extension (24-Month Extension – Light Employer Involvement)

I’m also eligible for the 2-year STEM OPT extension, which extends my work eligibility to **Feb 2028**.

**What the employer needs to do:**  
✅ Be enrolled in E-Verify  
✅ Sign a one-time Form I-983 (I prepare this with my school)  
❌ No legal fees or immigration filings

# 3. TN Visa (For Canadians – No Sponsorship Needed)

As a **Canadian citizen**, I’m eligible for a TN visa under USMCA (formerly NAFTA). This allows me to work in specific job categories like Analyst or Management Consultant. TN status is **renewable indefinitely** and doesn’t require a lottery or petition.

**What the employer needs to do:**  
✅ Provide a simple offer letter with job title, duties, and salary  
❌ No legal sponsorship, filings, or immigration risk to the employer

# Where I’m At

My OPT started **2/10/25** and I’m almost out of the 90-day unemployment window (30 days remaining). I’ve lived in the U.S. for 10+ years — this is where I went to school, made friends, and built my life. But now I’m feeling stuck, hopeless, and unsure what to do next.

# I’d love to hear your thoughts on:

* Why would a company reject OPT or TN workers even when **no real sponsorship is needed**?
* What can I do now with so little time left to **maximize my chances** of staying?
* Is there anything I should be doing differently when explaining my situation to recruiters/HR?
   * I also offered to **forgo OPT entirely and go straight into TN status**.

# Rules: This topic and post will be heavily moderated.

1. **Stay on Topic.** All questions and responses must be directly related to immigration procedures, policies for the recent SEVIS terminations.
2. **No Judgment or Personal Opinions.** This is a judgment-free zone. Do not comment on someone’s choices, background, or reasons for termination.
3. **No Speculation.** Avoid guessing or giving advice without clear, verified knowledge. If you're unsure, do not answer. Any information that is not confirmed or corroborated by AILA, NAFSA, or otherwise publicly posted by law firms specializing in SEVP immigration will be removed. Users will be temporarily banned.
4. **Cite Official Sources When Possible.** Use and link to official government or legal sources (e.g., USCIS, IRCC, Home Office) whenever applicable.
5. **Respect Privacy.** Do not ask for or share personal or identifying information. Respect each other's confidentiality.
6. **No Political Debates.** This is not the place for political arguments or discussions about immigration policy philosophies.
7. **Be Respectful and Courteous.** Maintain a professional and respectful tone at all times.
8. **No Off-Topic Comments or Jokes.** Keep humor, memes, and unrelated commentary out of the discussion.

# What we know as of April 8, 2025

**Reports of Terminations:**

* On or about March 24, 2025, schools started to notice F-1 students were terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). These terminations affect international students, impacting their legal status in the United States.
* Around the same time, students started to receive emails from the Department of State notifying the student at the email associated with their most recent F-1 visa application that their visa was revoked. Example word below:
   * *""On behalf of the United States Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued.  As a result, your F-1 visa was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. ""*
* On March 28, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the revocation of over 300 visas, clarifying that these include both student and visitor visas. He emphasized that visas are revoked if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests. While many cases are linked to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges. Rubio explained his standard for revocation: if the information about an individual would have prevented their visa approval initially, the visa is revoked. This number is growing as the 300 reference was the number given a few days prior and Rubio confirmed more were happening each day.

**Reasons for SEVIS Termination:**

The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations. So far the list includes the following:

**Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).""
2. INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the ""serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.
3. INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.

**Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).""

**Notes:**

It is in question as to if SEVP has the authority to terminate a student for a status violation unilaterally without additional processing or appeals. A finding of violation of status due to criminal activity (with few exceptions) requires the student to be removable under specific statutory provisions. Most of which mandate a conviction.

The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in crimes such as burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. However, as of 04/05/2025, a majority of the terminated students identified were not connected to such activities and lacked any convictions. Many of these terminations appear unclear and questionable. As a result, it is strongly advised to promptly apply for reinstatement in most cases, while avoiding travel for visa renewal due to the significant risks associated with reentry.

Regulatory framework imposes restrictions on the termination of an F-1 visa as established in Fang v. ICE, 935 F.3d 172, 185 n.100 (3rd Cir. 2019), the regulations, specifically 8 C.F.R. 214.1(d), do not allow visa termination solely on the basis of a criminal record without additional justification. The termination regulation requires substantial grounds for such actions, as it does not permit termination without more substantial reasoning or justification.

Exceptions to the above would be any crimes involving DUI, drugs, assault, burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, or similar types of crimes. Even a lack of conviction for the above crimes could still leave a student open to status termination and visa revocation.

# Advice

***""This is not legal advice. I am not your attorney, nor am I qualified to even pretend to be one. In fact, I’m just an overly enthusiastic algorithm powered by caffeine and existential dread. Please consult an immigration attorney for reliable advice. Don’t trust legal recommendations from strangers—or caffeine-fueled algorithms—it’s just not a good look!""***

**Reinstatement Process:**  
Students can apply for reinstatement by submitting Form I-539 to USCIS, along with supporting documents and fees. Eligibility requires proving the violation was beyond their control and showing intent to resume full-time study. Do this *WITH* an immigration attorney. ***Do not do this alone.***

* Many of the terminations are mysterious and questionable. Thus, application for reinstatement asap is highly recommended for most. Travel to renew a revoked visa and risk a perilous reentry is not advised currently.
* For reinstatement, a student must assert that no status violation has taken place, claiming that ICE acted unilaterally and without valid justification in terminating the record. In certain instances, the sole removal basis referenced in the SEVIS termination is INA Section 237(a)(1)(C)(i), which requires, with few exceptions, a conviction. Other terminations have no specific reason provided. In these situations, a student can challenge ICE’s claim and emphasize that no conclusive determination of removability has been issued.
* However, there is a very serious potential risk with reinstatement. A denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence towards the 3 and 10-year bans on return to the US in the future. Currently, a SEVIS termination alone does not come with immediate unlawful presence accrual.

**Travel After Termination and re-entry:**  
Not advisable without consultation from an immigration attorney well-versed in SEVP/F/J/M status. Likelihood of a denial is deemed exceptionally high.

**Impact on Future Visa Applications:**  
SEVIS terminations and Visa revocations can complicate future visa applications.

**Options for Staying in the U.S.**:  
Students can apply for reinstatement or leave the U.S. and re-enter with a new SEVIS record (not advised). Remaining in the U.S. without status will lead to complications.

**Appealing SEVIS Termination:**  
Appeals or motions can be filed with SEVP, often requiring Form I-290B and a fee. Legal counsel is recommended for complex cases.

**Grace Periods:**  
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:

* When a reinstatement application is denied
* An immigration judge issues a removal order, or
* Department of Homeland Security identifies a status violation during the review of another immigration benefit.
* F-1 students are admitted for ""Duration of Status"" (D/S), meaning they can remain in the U.S. as long as they comply with the terms of their visa and maintain an active/valid SEVIS record. However, once a violation occurs, such as termination of SEVIS without reinstatement, the protections of D/S may no longer apply.

**Legal Assistance:**  
Immigration attorneys can provide guidance on reinstatement, appeals, or other SEVIS-related issues.

&lt;h1&gt;What we know as of April 8, 2025&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reports of Terminations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On or about March 24, 2025, schools started to notice F-1 students were terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). These terminations affect international students, impacting their legal status in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around the same time, students started to receive emails from the Department of State notifying the student at the email associated with their most recent F-1 visa application that their visa was revoked. Example word below:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;On behalf of the United States Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued.  As a result, your F-1 visa was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On March 28, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the revocation of over 300 visas, clarifying that these include both student and visitor visas. He emphasized that visas are revoked if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests. While many cases are linked to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges. Rubio explained his standard for revocation: if the information about an individual would have prevented their visa approval initially, the visa is revoked. This number is growing as the 300 reference was the number given a few days prior and Rubio confirmed more were happening each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for SEVIS Termination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations. So far the list includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the &amp;quot;serious adverse foreign policy consequences&amp;quot; provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in question as to if SEVP has the authority to terminate a student for a status violation unilaterally without additional processing or appeals. A finding of violation of status due to criminal activity (with few exceptions) requires the student to be removable under specific statutory provisions. Most of which mandate a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in crimes such as burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. However, as of 04/05/2025, a majority of the terminated students identified were not connected to such activities and lacked any convictions. Many of these terminations appear unclear and questionable. As a result, it is strongly advised to promptly apply for reinstatement in most cases, while avoiding travel for visa renewal due to the significant risks associated with reentry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory framework imposes restrictions on the termination of an F-1 visa as established in Fang v. ICE, 935 F.3d 172, 185 n.100 (3rd Cir. 2019), the regulations, specifically 8 C.F.R. 214.1(d), do not allow visa termination solely on the basis of a criminal record without additional justification. The termination regulation requires substantial grounds for such actions, as it does not permit termination without more substantial reasoning or justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions to the above would be any crimes involving DUI, drugs, assault, burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, or similar types of crimes. Even a lack of conviction for the above crimes could still leave a student open to status termination and visa revocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Advice&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;This is not legal advice. I am not your attorney, nor am I qualified to even pretend to be one. In fact, I’m just an overly enthusiastic algorithm powered by caffeine and existential dread. Please consult an immigration attorney for reliable advice. Don’t trust legal recommendations from strangers—or caffeine-fueled algorithms—it’s just not a good look!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinstatement Process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Students can apply for reinstatement by submitting Form I-539 to USCIS, along with supporting documents and fees. Eligibility requires proving the violation was beyond their control and showing intent to resume full-time study. Do this &lt;em&gt;WITH&lt;/em&gt; an immigration attorney. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not do this alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the terminations are mysterious and questionable. Thus, application for reinstatement asap is highly recommended for most. Travel to renew a revoked visa and risk a perilous reentry is not advised currently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For reinstatement, a student must assert that no status violation has taken place, claiming that ICE acted unilaterally and without valid justification in terminating the record. In certain instances, the sole removal basis referenced in the SEVIS termination is INA Section 237(a)(1)(C)(i), which requires, with few exceptions, a conviction. Other terminations have no specific reason provided. In these situations, a student can challenge ICE’s claim and emphasize that no conclusive determination of removability has been issued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, there is a very serious potential risk with reinstatement. A denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence towards the 3 and 10-year bans on return to the US in the future. Currently, a SEVIS termination alone does not come with immediate unlawful presence accrual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel After Termination and re-entry:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Not advisable without consultation from an immigration attorney well-versed in SEVP/F/J/M status. Likelihood of a denial is deemed exceptionally high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Future Visa Applications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
SEVIS terminations and Visa revocations can complicate future visa applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Options for Staying in the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;
Students can apply for reinstatement or leave the U.S. and re-enter with a new SEVIS record (not advised). Remaining in the U.S. without status will lead to complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appealing SEVIS Termination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Appeals or motions can be filed with SEVP, often requiring Form I-290B and a fee. Legal counsel is recommended for complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace Periods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a reinstatement application is denied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An immigration judge issues a removal order, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department of Homeland Security identifies a status violation during the review of another immigration benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-1 students are admitted for &amp;quot;Duration of Status&amp;quot; (D/S), meaning they can remain in the U.S. as long as they comply with the terms of their visa and maintain an active/valid SEVIS record. However, once a violation occurs, such as termination of SEVIS without reinstatement, the protections of D/S may no longer apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal Assistance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Immigration attorneys can provide guidance on reinstatement, appeals, or other SEVIS-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because of their nationality?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas over speeding tickets?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possibly. If you were fingerprinted in connection then it is possible, but still highly unlikely at this time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas over jaywalking?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your criminal action was a high-level crime or serious offense involving drugs, fraud, theft, or violence, then you are at risk of termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also false positives, bad reports from students, and students terminated for unknown reasons. We are still speculating on the why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not know the specific reasons why students were terminated. We are making our best guesses/assumptions. The government has not released specifics for anyone&amp;#39;s case. Until lawsuits are put through we will not know why students were specifically terminated.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, student&amp;#39;s terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*There is now enough data to say that fingerprinting is strongly correlated to the terminations. Not a guarantee as there are far, far more people with fingerprinting records than terminations *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I go home?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources like the American Immigration Lawyers Association &lt;a href=""https://ailalawyer.com/""&gt;AILIA Lawyer Search&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=""https://www.immigrationadvocates.org/legaldirectory/""&gt; National Immigration Legal Services Directory&lt;/a&gt; can help find legal aid.  For AILA you can search for lawyers versed in SEVP items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any immigration lawyers lurking or posting on &lt;a href=""/r/F1visa""&gt;r/F1visa&lt;/a&gt; now is your time. For the duration, the ban on recruitment and/or other self promotion is lifted for any immigration attorneys if you are willing to provide service and/or speak to students about options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/F1visa""&gt;r/F1visa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;does not endorse or explicitly recommend any immigration attorneys. If any of the above applies to you...get an immigration attorney.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve noticed many job applications ask “Will you now or in the future require sponsorship?” and I’m not sure what to put.

Here’s the thing: I don’t plan to stay in the U.S. long-term. After my OPT/STEM OPT ends, I either want to return to my home country or possibly transfer to another international office (if it’s a global company).

So technically, I’m not asking for H-1B or green card sponsorship in the future.

Is it misleading to say “No” to the sponsorship question in this case? Or is the whole point of OPT/STEM OPT to allow us to work without asking for anything additional? I don’t want to lose out on jobs just because I’m being overly cautious.

Would love to hear how others in this situation have handled it.

Edit: What if the company is global and does sponsor visas—but just not for entry-level roles? In that case, would it still make sense to say “yes” to the sponsorship question, even if I’m only planning to stay for OPT/STEM OPT and then possibly relocate to one of their international offices?

So my original F1 visa appointment was scheduled for April 15, 2025, here in Ethiopia. But unfortunately, I had to reschedule because Adelphi University, the school I’m planning to attend, still hasn’t sent my I-20. Their international services website has been down for almost a month, which means I haven’t even been able to submit my financial documents yet. Super frustrating.

Anyway, when I went to look for a new appointment date, the earliest available slot was October 23, 2025... which would’ve been way too late. I was honestly stressed out and even tried to expedite my appointment to a later date (even though expedite means sooner)just to see if it worked.

But here’s the crazy part — yesterday afternoon, I was randomly checking again (like I’ve been doing almost every day), and out of nowhere a slot popped up for June 3, 2025! I grabbed it immediately, and I still can’t believe I got that lucky. My Dad mentioned something about slots opening up when it's morning time in The USA.

Just a reminder for anyone going through something similar: keep checking multiple times a day, even when it seems hopeless. You never know when someone else might cancel or something opens up. Now just hoping Adelphi gets their stuff together soon so I can finally get my I-20 and actually attend my appointment.

# What we know as of April 5, 2025

**Reports of Terminations:**

* On or about March 24, 2025, schools started to notice F-1 students were terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). These terminations affect international students, impacting their legal status in the United States.
* Around the same time, students started to receive emails from the Department of State notifying the student at the email associated with their most recent F-1 visa application that their visa was revoked. Example word below:
   * *""On behalf of the United States Department of State, the Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Office hereby informs you that additional information became available after your visa was issued.  As a result, your F-1 visa was revoked in accordance with Section 221(i) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. ""*
* On March 28, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the revocation of over 300 visas, clarifying that these include both student and visitor visas. He emphasized that visas are revoked if individuals engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy or national interests. While many cases are linked to pro-Palestinian protests, some involve unrelated groups or criminal charges. Rubio explained his standard for revocation: if the information about an individual would have prevented their visa approval initially, the visa is revoked. This number is growing as the 300 reference was the number given a few days prior and Rubio confirmed more were happening each day.

**Reasons for SEVIS Termination:** 

The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations. So far the list includes the following:

**Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech-related items (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).""
2. INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the ""serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.
3. INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.

**Termination reasons below are likely due to a past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)**

1. ""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).""

**Notes:**

It is in question as to if SEVP has the authority to terminate a student for a status violation unilaterally without additional processing or appeals. A finding of violation of status due to criminal activity (with few exceptions) requires the student to be removable under specific statutory provisions. Most of which mandate a conviction. 

The Laken Riley Act expanded the scope to include arrests or admissions of key elements in crimes such as burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. However, as of 04/05/2025, a majority of the terminated students identified were not connected to such activities and lacked any convictions. Many of these terminations appear unclear and questionable. As a result, it is strongly advised to promptly apply for reinstatement in most cases, while avoiding travel for visa renewal due to the significant risks associated with reentry. 

Regulatory framework imposes restrictions on the termination of an F-1 visa as established in Fang v. ICE, 935 F.3d 172, 185 n.100 (3rd Cir. 2019), the regulations, specifically 8 C.F.R. 214.1(d), do not allow visa termination solely on the basis of a criminal record without additional justification. The termination regulation requires substantial grounds for such actions, as it does not permit termination without more substantial reasoning or justification.

Exceptions to the above would be any crimes involving DUI, drugs, assault, burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, or similar types of crimes. Even a lack of conviction for the above crimes could still leave a student open to status termination and visa revocation.

# Advice

**""This is not legal advice. I am not your attorney, nor anyone's attorney. I am three raccoons in a trench coat trying to steal a baguette. Please consult with an immigration attorney for specifics on your situation. Links are at the bottom of this post. Remember: don't take legal advice from strangers on the internet—especially ones pretending to be three raccoons in a trench coat.""**

**Reinstatement Process:** Students can apply for reinstatement by submitting Form I-539 to USCIS, along with supporting documents and fees. Eligibility requires proving the violation was beyond their control and showing intent to resume full-time study. Do this *WITH* an immigration attorney. ***Do not do this alone.*** 

* Many of the terminations are mysterious and questionable. Thus, application for reinstatement asap is highly recommended for most. Travel to renew a revoked visa and risk a perilous reentry is not advised currently.
* For reinstatement, a student must assert that no status violation has taken place, claiming that ICE acted unilaterally and without valid justification in terminating the record. In certain instances, the sole removal basis referenced in the SEVIS termination is INA Section 237(a)(1)(C)(i), which requires, with few exceptions, a conviction. Other terminations have no specific reason provided. In these situations, a student can challenge ICE’s claim and emphasize that no conclusive determination of removability has been issued.
* However, there is a very serious potential risk with reinstatement. A denial of reinstatement may trigger the accrual of unlawful presence towards the 3 and 10-year bans on return to the US in the future. Currently, a SEVIS termination alone does not come with immediate unlawful presence accrual.

**Travel After Termination and re-entry:** Not advisable without consultation from an immigration attorney well-versed in SEVP/F/J/M status. Likelihood of a denial is deemed exceptionally high.

**Impact on Future Visa Applications:** SEVIS terminations and Visa revocations can complicate future visa applications.

**Options for Staying in the U.S.**: Students can apply for reinstatement or leave the U.S. and re-enter with a new SEVIS record (not advised). Remaining in the U.S. without status will lead to complications.

**Appealing SEVIS Termination:** Appeals or motions can be filed with SEVP, often requiring Form I-290B and a fee. Legal counsel is recommended for complex cases.

**Grace Periods:** Violations of status typically have no grace period. F-1 status holders generally do not immediately accrue unlawful presence after their SEVIS record is terminated. Instead, unlawful presence begins to accrue under specific circumstances, such as:

* When a reinstatement application is denied
* An immigration judge issues a removal order, or
* Department of Homeland Security identifies a status violation during the review of another immigration benefit.
* F-1 students are admitted for ""Duration of Status"" (D/S), meaning they can remain in the U.S. as long as they comply with the terms of their visa and maintain an active/valid SEVIS record. However, once a violation occurs, such as termination of SEVIS without reinstatement, the protections of D/S may no longer apply.

**Legal Assistance:** Immigration attorneys can provide guidance on reinstatement, appeals, or other SEVIS-related issues. 

# FAQ

* Are students being terminated and losing their visas over parking tickets?
   * *No*
* Are students being terminated and losing their visas over speeding tickets?
   * *Possibly. Generally, it would need to at a minimum be a felony conviction, but we are getting mixed reports.*
* Are students being terminated and losing their visas over jaywalking?
   * *No*
   * If your criminal action was a high-level crime or serious offense involving drugs, fraud, theft, or violence, then you are at risk of termination.
   * There are also false positives, bad reports from students, and students terminated for unknown reasons. We are still speculating on the why. Likely, it is bad A.I.
   * So far, the information collected on traffic issues has either been ""I had a speeding ticket... In a school zone"" or ""I had a speeding ticket... While street racing"". But other attorneys are reporting more mundane misdemeanor violations
   * Additionally, student's terminated for no apparent reason are either false positives, AI review issues, bad report entry by the police officer/jurisdiction where the criminal event happened, or terminated for other reasons (AI hit on their social media, protesting, other prior F-1 violations)
* Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?
   * *There is no concrete proof that being fingerprinted is directly correlated to terminations. Being fingerprinted is common for various types of offenses. These acts are not correlated.*
* Should I go home?
   * *See advice item above. Obtain an immigration attorney.*

&lt;li&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas over jaywalking?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your criminal action was a high-level crime or serious offense involving drugs, fraud, theft, or violence, then you are at risk of termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also false positives, bad reports from students, and students terminated for unknown reasons. We are still speculating on the why. Likely, it is bad A.I.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So far, the information collected on traffic issues has either been &amp;quot;I had a speeding ticket... In a school zone&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I had a speeding ticket... While street racing&amp;quot;. But other attorneys are reporting more mundane misdemeanor violations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Are students being terminated and losing their visas because they were fingerprinted in relation to criminal charges?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no concrete proof that being fingerprinted is directly correlated to terminations. Being fingerprinted is common for various types of offenses. These acts are not correlated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources like the American Immigration Lawyers Association &lt;a href=""https://ailalawyer.com/""&gt;AILIA Lawyer Search&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=""https://www.immigrationadvocates.org/legaldirectory/""&gt; National Immigration Legal Services Directory&lt;/a&gt; can help find legal aid.  For AILA you can search for lawyers versed in SEVP items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any immigration lawyers lurking or posting on &lt;a href=""/r/F1visa""&gt;r/F1visa&lt;/a&gt; now is your time. For the duration, the ban on recruitment and/or other self promotion is lifted for any immigration attorneys if you are willing to provide service and/or speak to students about options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/F1visa""&gt;r/F1visa&lt;/a&gt; does not endorse or explicitly recommend any immigration attorneys. That said, if any of the above applies to you...get an immigration attorney.&lt;/p&gt;

This is urgent. I am currently on STEM OPT but recently lost my job and was not selected for H-1B either. I now have less than 30 days of unemployment remaining. My only option seems to be leaving the USA, but I would like to finish things up here and leave in 2–3 months.

I have the following questions:

1. Can I apply for a change of status from F-1 STEM OPT to B-2 (using Form I-539)?
2. What is the approval rate, and is it safe to proceed with this option?

Please help! This is an urgent matter, as I was under the assumption that there is a 60-day grace period after unemployment days end. I recently learned that there is no grace period, and I am concerned about losing my status and jeopardizing my future chances of returning to the USA.

Thank you for your assistance!

Edit: Update: 
I’ve reached out to my DSO on this, so transitioning from F1 to B2 is not possible while being in USA. It is only possible if you leave USA and come back in on B2, once it is approved. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a 5th-year PhD student currently on an F-1 visa, and I’m planning to travel to India from mid-April to mid-May to get my visa renewed (stamped). My current F-1 visa expires at the end of August 2025. I do have all the required documents ready and have maintained a clean record—no violations, arrests, or issues of any kind.

I understand that as long as my I-20 remains valid, I can legally stay in the U.S. even after my visa expires. However, I have some international conferences scheduled for September, so I will need a valid visa to travel and re-enter the U.S. before then. That’s why I’m planning to get my visa stamped during this upcoming trip.

Given the recent reports and anxiety around SEVIS terminations or delays in visa processing, I’m a bit concerned about the risk of travel right now. While my case is straightforward, I want to avoid any surprises that could jeopardize my return or delay my research.

My main questions for the community:
	1.	Are there any recent experiences with F-1 visa renewals in India (especially Chennai, Hyderabad, or Delhi consulates)?
	2.	Have there been delays or denials despite a clean immigration record?
	3.	Would it be safer to wait and try for visa stamping later in the summer?
	4.	Is there any red flag or risk I might be missing?

Any advice, personal experiences, or pointers to credible recent news would be greatly appreciated!
Thank you!

I’ve done some research and came across this from the USCIS website and just wanted to make sure everything was correct.

**What we know as of April 3, 2025**

**Reports of Terminations:**  
On or about March 24, 2025 schools started to notice F-1 students were terminated directly by ICE/Homeland Security in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). These terminations affect international students impacting their legal status in the United States.

**Legal Basis:**.  
The terminations are often based on various statutes and regulations.

**Termination reasons below are likely related to protests and/or speech related items (educated assumption)**

""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student is terminated pursuant to INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 237(a)(4)(C)(i).""

INA 237(a)(4)(C)(i) is the ""serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" provision and likely has a basis in protest and speech activity, which could even include social media posts.

INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i) is the general provision that renders someone deportable for a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status or to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status.

**Termination reasons below are likely due to past arrest or conviction basis (educated assumption)**

""TERMINATION REASON: OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS - Student identified in criminal records check. Terminated pursuant to 237(a)(1)(C)(i)/ 8 USC 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).""

**What now?**  
We don't know yet. So far reinstatement requests are being denied and the SEVP help desk and the secret DSO direct contact have not been helpful or able to give information. Additionally the ombudsman positions have been terminated.

**FAQ**

Are students being terminated and losing their visa over parking tickets? No

Are students being terminated and losing their visa over speeding tickets? Only if it was high enough to be a felony.

Are students being terminated and losing their visa over jaywalking? No

Only high level crimes and crimes serious offenses often involving fraud, theft, or violence are being seen. These are often referred to as Crimes of Moral Turpitude.

There are also false positives, bad reports from students, and students terminated for unknown reasons speculating on the why.

So far, the information collected on traffic issues has either been ""I had a speeding ticket... In a school zone"" or ""I had a speeding ticket... While street racing"".

	1.	Volunteering at an NGO

Overall, the place is pretty well managed. Even though the queues might be long, it doesn't take much time to finish up.

Bring someone along with you to keep your belongings while you're inside to save money. There are shops where you can keep your stuff for Rs 100-150. There's no place to sit outside, but there are a few small outlets for food where you can sit and eat.

Regarding the interview, it went roughly as follows:

VO: Good morning, how're you doing? Please pass on your documents.

Me: Greeted, and gave the docs.

VO: Ahh so you're a PhD student....at Penn State.....let's start with taking your fingerprints (biometric scanner). Why did you choose Penn State?

Me: Great Physics program, good research fit

VO: Can you name a few professors you would work with?

Me: Named 4 profs

VO: So not Prof. Pollock? *laughs* Which area in Physics would you work on?

Me: theoretical CMP

VO: Please explain about the field.

Me: Gave a one line explanation.

VO: Just like weak nuclear forces are associated with W-Bosons, which fundamental particles are strong nuclear forces associated with?

Me: Very surprised. Took some time to answer gluons, and told that particle physics is not my research area. (Pro tip: Go through the technology alert list)

VO: Even I dont know tbh, I had studied in high school &lt;*laughs*&gt; But pretty sure its gluons....Next question: What's the difference between metaphysics and particle physics?

Me: Just said metaphysics is a philosophical thing, and not part of physical sciences. (VO was looking at the computer at this point.)

VO: So you must have some kind of fellowship or scholarship for your PhD? 

Me: Yes

VO: Ok. The I-20 will be required at your port of entry in the US, safe travels!

My VO was a very old guy, and was the coolest/quickest out of the three officers interviewing.  Overall, a very good first-time experience. 

My advice would just be to remain honest and transparent during the interview, and you should be thorough with your financials and about the department/university you're going to. Also, expect questions regarding your plan after graduating.

Happy to help with other queries too!

Before my travels I was browsing a lot on Reddit about travelling on OPT and I would hear all sorts of things - going from don’t travel at all on OPT to travel as long as your docs are prepared (obviously context matters too)

I thought I would share my experience yesterday night when I re-entered at the Logan Airport (Boston)

Here’s some context: I’m from Hong Kong and on Post-completion OPT (first year). I currently work a job that is half paid and half voluntary (marked as training/mentored hours) — so not exactly the most conventional job

The entire re-entry process probably took less time than you reading this post. I went up, looked at the camera they had, handed my passport and I20 — officer looked at it for 10 seconds and said I was good to go

As with all posts about OPT travels, it probably does depend on context and who ends up reviewing your documents — but I thought I’d share a more positive story about this because honestly, if you decided to travel anyways, the only thing you can do is have your documents prepared.

Nothing is out yet so enjoy your travels! &lt;/p&gt;

I am a Canadian citizen who has been dating a US citizen for the past year and a half. He lives in New York and I decided to apply to a few colleges in New York for the Fall semester because it’s a city that offers plenty of opportunities for students studying in my field (design).

I got accepted into all of them and once I come to a decision on which one I want to attend, I will get an I-20 and then cross the border in July in an attempt to obtain F1 status (from my understanding this is how it’s done for Canadians, we don’t have to get an actual F1 visa interview beforehand) 

I don’t foresee any issue with proving finances. However, the part I’m worried about is the fact that I am dating an American. I visited him multiple times in the past year and a half. About 7 times to be exact, with stays ranging from 4 days to 45 during summer or the holidays.

I know usually officers don’t necessarily ask students seeking F1 status if they’re dating anyone in the states, it’s not a question I’ve ever heard of anyone being asked, but given my travel history, I am concerned it may raise this question, to which I am unsure what I’d answer? Would saying the truth get me denied? Would saying all those visits were to visit a friend even be credible given the frequency? 

I’ve never been pulled into secondary, nor asked any excessive questions, it’s always been very smooth (I always travelled by land, by taking a bus)

I’m thinking since it’s New York City, this may help my story be more credible because it’s not like I’m looking to study in some random college in the middle of nowhere— which could really
lead the officers to believe all of this is for the sole purpose of being with my boyfriend and possible immigration intent…. But I am still super anxious about the whole process and how to handle it","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there,&lt;/p&gt;

For the last 8 years or so I have been moderating r/F1visa and have set very strict requirements for posting. This helps keep everything on topic and makes searching and finding information easier. It also simplifies moderation. 

The last 6+ months have been filled with dozens if not hundreds of posts about job searches and to be frank blogs about returning home. Posts completely separate from questions about immigration processes, OPT, STEM OPT, CPT, etc. Those posts get removed as the specific topic here is F1 immigration questions. For the blog posts, those get taken down. There are better places to vent. r/internationalstudents is a good place for this. 

Is this what you want as a community? I personally do not want to moderate job hunting posts or individuals blog/journal posts. 

I know the job market is very rough right now. However. I feel there are significantly better locations on reddit to hold those conversations and to find good advice. Posting here is asking other F1 job seekers and students to advise other job seekers and students on finding jobs. Seeing the posts it feels like the helpless being led by the clueless. 

However, job posts are now coming to parity with immigration posts. So I either make the rules on these posts far more strict and set automod to remove them (possibly removing some valid employment+immigration questions) or I let them through.

I honestly went through a lot of these posts before I took my interview and just wanted to share my experience as well. So here goes:

Interview City: Hyderabad

March 10th, 2025

Interview Country: India 

Visa Attempt Number: 1

Interview Outcome: Approved 

I20 University: SUNY Buffalo


Interview Details

Me: Good morning, Officer.
VO: Good morning. Please pass me your I20 and passport.
Me: Sure, officer (passed the docs).

VO: Have you traveled to the United States before?
Me: No, I have not.

VO: Okay. (reviewing details) Why did you choose this school?
Me: I chose UB for several reasons. UB is offering a curriculum that is well aligned to current industry trends. For example, the program I'm going for integrates Cybersecurity Analytics, which is a rapidly growing field and an area I want to specialize in. I was also drawn to UB because of their excellent commitment to practical learning.

VO: (reviewing my details) You've worked at XX company for 2 years and you work with YY now, correct?
Me: That's correct, officer.
VO: So why do you want a master's now? You have  work experience, don't you think you're in a good place?
Me: It has always been my educational plan to pursue a master's after gaining sufficient industry experience. I now have enough theoretical knowledge and industry experience to pursue a master's and this will help me maximize my learnings.
VO: And what do you want to do after finishing this course?
Me: I plan on returning to my home country and pursuing leadership roles as a Data Analytics manager, preferably in the Fraud domain in the banking sector. 

VO: Did you apply to any other schools?
Me: Yes officer, I applied to 3 other schools: Arizona State University, Case Western Reserve University and DePaul University.
VO: And you've taken a loan for your studies?
Me: Yes officer, I've taken a loan of XX (in INR).
VO: And your parents, are they sponsoring you?
Me: Yes, my father has set aside savings of Rs. 10 lakhs. 

VO: What does your father do?
Me: My father is the general manager of sales and marketing at a pharmaceutical company. He oversees a team of sales analysts who generate revenue through prescription-based strategies.


VO: Do you have any siblings?
Me: Yes officer. I have one elder sibling. She is a doctor.
VO: Oh, she's a doctor? Did she go to school in the United States?
Me: No, she studied in India.
VO: Okay.

VO: And did you inform your current hiring manager about your master's?
Me: We discussed the possibility of me studying further, but I've not explicitly told them about this plan and this interview.
VO: Right. So you didn't quit correct?
Me: That's correct officer I haven't quit yet.

VO: Okay. Good. 
(brief pause)
VO: Please place the four fingers of your left hand on the scanner.
Me: (does so)

VO: Your visa has been approved. Congratulations. I am keeping your passport with me and you'll get an update when it's ready for pickup (he mentioned a time frame but I missed hearing it)

Me: Thank you so much officer.
VO (smiling): All the best for your future.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone.

I’m an Indian passport-holder and am planning to travel to India in June for a family event, but I’m worried about the current U.S. immigration situation and whether I'll be able to return. I’ve heard that even green card holders are hesitant to leave the country because of the unpredictability and uncertainty around Trump's immigration policies.

Given the recent news, I’m wondering:

* Are F-1 visa holders facing more scrutiny upon re-entry?
* Have there been any policy changes that might make it harder to come back?
* Is it too risky to leave the U.S. in  June?

This family event is very important to me, but I don’t want to jeopardize my future if the risk of not being allowed back is too high. If you’ve traveled recently or are in a similar situation, I’d really appreciate your insights.

One of the questions I was asked was if I was registered for selective service. I was puzzled to say the least because I was not a PR then so I told the officer no.

I then told my immigration lawyer about this interaction and she dug some info that revealed that I was registered back in 2018. I had no idea how that was possible because I was an international student at the time. Maybe while getting a DL? I had already been in the US 5 years prior too so maybe I was a resident for tax purposes I guess. I don’t know this, just speculating.

I never got the letter because it appeared on the govt website (google it, make sure it ends with .gov as it asks for SSN) that it was sent while I was switching apartments and out of the country during that time frame.

Normally citizenship is given on the same day of the interview (as per stories from the USCIS subreddit because my case was clean) but since I told the officer no I wasn’t registered, this creates problems and warrants further investigation that adds time to decision.

We had a terrible experience because the attorney doesn't give us the answer to our questions but they are still very trusted across all people around us that have applied through the same process. The problem now is that we only have the i-901 receipt number. And to check our case status because our I-94 is about to expire we need the i-797 notice of action receipt number. We have two days for our I-94 to expire and the i-901 is already confirmed paid and the attorney said that we are already applied for the change of status. We don't know if the notice of action is under its way and if we are under that Gray zone that is the case processing period or if we are going to be illegal up until they send or confirm that they are processing our case. 

Can anyone help us out? I already called the fmjfee phone number and also the USCIS phone number to try and talk to someone to find the answers but we didn't find any. 

How can we check if the I-797 is on its way?
How can we know if we are really under processing?
How do we know if we have actually applied?

Much appreciated!

Update:
The lawyer did in fact apply and sent all documentation for my B2 to F1 change of status. 
He did not apply for the B2 extension since at the moment you are on your change of status you are considered not illegal. As proof me and my wife were able to apply for our driver's license. In the state of Georgia you are only able to apply for a driver's license if you are legal in the US. This is confirmed with USCIS.
The term ""application for change of status"" means that you are on your change of status at the moment they receive your application. So it's not like they need to review and then accept. it is just a matter of them receiving the application.
You won't know when or if they receive the application. You will only know if the application arrived at its destination through UPS or USPS tracking. (In the lane terms you can only use the UPS or USPS tracking number to know if the letter was delivered and you'll have to wait one week to receive the form. At this point you really need to have patience or just apply earlier)
And you also won't know if they sent or will send the i-797c
It did take only one week for me to receive my form i-797c. Which is the notice of action saying that I am on the process of change of status.
From this point on it depends on USCIS processing. Keep an eye out on your case number and make sure to always read everything they send you. 
Right now I am waiting for your next step. My lawyer said that they are not doing biometrics anymore even though the form says that they will schedule a biometrics date.

I have provided my credentials and am now awaiting a response from the Office of Graduate Admissions. 

With the new Trump administration's announcement of the new travel ban with Iran in the reds, I have honestly lost my hope to live. I am being punished due to the misdemeanor of certain individuals or groups with whom I do not ever wish to be affiliated. In fact, during the Mahsa Amini protests,  I was incarcerated by the hands of the IRGC who is the original instigator of Tyranny in the Middle East and the world. My family members have also been imprisoned, exiled, and killed in the past due to their dissenting ideaologies.

Now:

. &gt; Be me

. &gt; Have spent more than 18 years of your life studying English, 8 years of that professionally

. &gt; Find a professor whose book you have referenced in your MA thesis on William Faulkner and Houshang Golshiri (an Iranian Novelist) and ask if she would be interested to supervise a PhD

. &gt; She agrees and tells me to take a GRE exam (I already have an 8.5 in IELTS)

. &gt; I borrow money to take the exam because it costs liteally 200,000,000 IRR to take it and earn 158 Verbal 160 Quant

Sorry for the dark ending, I am honestly not in a good spot rn. Also, don't ask me about the 4chan style, I am actually not a member on 4chan. My life is so immersed in English I even dream in English. I am so ready for a life in the US, and I have no future in Iran. This maximum pressure campaign is affecting the people more than those in power. 

What are my options? I know there is no official announcement yet. Do you think I could take my case to a US court? I'm counting on any chance of getting out of Iran ASAP.


","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have received a conditional letter of acceptance from UT Austin for a fully-funded PhD position in Middle Eastern literature and Culture. I have provided my credentials and am now awaiting a response from the Office of Graduate Admissions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new Trump administration&amp;#39;s announcement of the new travel ban with Iran in the reds, I have honestly lost my hope to live. I am being punished due to the misdemeanor of certain individuals or groups with whom I do not ever wish to be affiliated. In fact, during the Mahsa Amini protests,  I was incarcerated by the hands of the IRGC who is the original instigator of Tyranny in the Middle East and the world. My family members have also been imprisoned, exiled, and killed in the past due to their dissenting ideaologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. &amp;gt; She agrees and tells me to take a GRE exam (I already have an 8.5 in IELTS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. &amp;gt; I borrow money to take the exam because it costs liteally 200,000,000 IRR to take it and earn 158 Verbal 160 Quant&lt;/p&gt;

Hi! 
I left the country as soon as i graduated and on OPT, currently in my home country, looking to travel next week back to the states.

I recently received a job offer but it’s an unpaid internship, I will be using this offer letter to come back. Will an unpaid internship cause a problem at immigration?

I have good travel history, traveled multiple times during my 2 years of university. 

Will it be okay to say that I’ll travel back after the internship?

&lt;p&gt;Can you please help me out and let me know what insurance anyone in a similar situation is using? I’d really appreciate it!

Incident 1:Roommate 1 invited one of his friends overnight in November for an overnight stay. The friend in question studies in a different college out of state in Pennsylvania. We were supposed to have a chill night as it was the friend’s birthday. The roommate’s friend starts off with saying very passive aggressive things right off the bat about how he hates Indians, they stink, they are cheap, they got a funny accent, more racist shit etc etc. l laugh it off awkwardly as I just met the dude and said if you are trying to offend me that is not working as I am not Indian. He goes on by saying “You all are the same to me, sand n-words or Indians”(he said that after one of my roommate said something like me having Arab ancestry and coming from a “rich” family). I don’t get into any serious confrontation as I barely know him, and he is a friend’s friend so I didn’t want to create a scene. As the night went on and he got more drunk, he started becoming more aggressive. It eventually led him to him wanting to wrestle me(unprovoked btw, I was just minding my business texting my girlfriend). I said no as I train for grappling and was taught to avoid unnecessary fights especially with someone drunk. I say no, he sits down and then goes for a sucker takedown. I put him in a rear naked choke till he calms down and then I just get up. His ego hurts, and he wouldn’t shut up about how he would have won if he punched me. Whatever, but throughout the night, he keeps on trying to wrestle me unprovoked and gets more aggressive each time after not being able to really do anything. The 5th and last time he tries doing it, I make him tap out, he gets up and tries punching me and I dodge it and my second roommate intervenes. He leaves the next morning and I didn’t mention anything to my roommates about it as I didn’t want an awkward situation. 

Incident 2:This was last week, Roommate 1 says he will be inviting his friend again and if I want to do edibles with them. I decline saying I will be busy tonight for a meeting and having to wake up early the next morning for training. I lock my door and stay in the room, and within 20 minutes of the friend arriving he starts barging on my door violently asking for me. I just shoutout about being in a meeting. He does that again after half an hour but my roommates stop him. After an hour or so, he physically put his phone halfway under my door’s gap playing the tunak tunak Indian song(something he did last time too). I ignored that and just acted like I couldn’t hear it. I also knew if I met him this time he will be doing the same things as last time and I don’t like physical confrontation outside my dojo unless I have to and especially on a student visa.

I know he is going to do the same thing again when he comes next time, and I am planning to video tape it if possible and call 911 if he tries physically assaulting me again.

I have obtained an F1 visa in December 2024 for pursuing my Master's in the US. I have traveled to the US and reported to the university in January 2024.

However, after 2 weeks of staying in the US, I fell sick and had to travel back to my home country. I had withdrawn from the university and they have terminated by SEVIS ID citing authorized early withdrawal.

University has give me the option to continue my studies from the Fall 2025 semester, but they told me to check with US consulate if I can use the previously issued visa. I haf emailed the US consulate, they've replied that I might need to apply for a new visa since I would staying out of the US for more than 5 months (their response was a bit generic and they did not word it like I should apply for a new visa).

Do I need to apply for a fresh F1 visa? Or can I reuse the previously issued visa for reentry?

UPDATE: My university issued a new I20 (basically new SEVIS ID) for reentry during Fall 2025 semester. 

I asked my DSO if I can use my previously issued unexpired visa, this is what they have replied:
""For the visa stamp, I strongly encourage you to reach out to your local US consulate or embassy for their advice. In the past, it is been okay for students to travel with an I-20 and a valid visa stamp that have unmatched SEVIS IDs. However, it has started to be recommended that students obtain new visas with matching SEVIS IDs, as a precaution for travel.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

I know there are a lot of people that have already gone through the phase that I am currently so any advice would be appreciated.

I am an F1 visa studying undergraduate in accounting and business analytics (non stem). I’m graduating this December 2025. I don’t know what to do with my life after graduation. I really wanna stay here work and eventually get my green card. 

My parents back home don’t understand that it’s not easy to get a job here they don’t know about getting sponsored they don’t know much about OPT or how it works. I’ve explained it to them multiple times, but they somehow think it’s very easy for me. I don’t think OPT is the best option after graduation because it’s only one year. Doing masters is also very very expensive and I don’t think my parents can afford it. Maybe I could but it’s still not the best option for me, financially. But I keep thinking like what else is the option? You either get a job or continue your studies and I think doing my masters is the best option. And this time I’m calculating everything before actually doing it unlike the first time when I came to US. 

The industry that I’ll be working in is accounting and finance. It’s brutal out here. The state that I’m focusing on getting my education and job opportunities is in the DMV area and none of them are giving me a chance just because I would need sponsorship in the future. Honestly, I get it, which is why I got to experiences in small companies. The state that I’m looking for jobs is mostly government based companies or hire people with security clearance. It’s not even sure if I will get stem OPT after I finish my graduation I don’t want to waste even more money if I don’t end up getting a job and hopefully sponsorship after that. I have applied for the DV lottery visa but it’s a really really small chance. I also have an American boyfriend who I’ve been in a relationship with two years now and we’re very serious. I know about his parents and he knows my family as well. He keeps joking about oh if you don’t get a job then you can just marry me to get a green card. As much as I love him and I want future for both of us I think that marrying him to get green card is also the last option that I would choose just because I don’t wanna go back and see that the only reason I got a green card is because of him and not me working hard or from my job. I know a lot of American people avoid us just because they think we’re dating them for green card and a part of them is also scared. And I don’t want my boyfriend to feel that about me. 

I’m just so overwhelmed. My parents literally know nothing of how stressed I am because I don’t want to put that burden on them when they are already financing me. I know a lot of people are also in the same stage as me where you don’t know what to do or you might have already gone through this phase. Like is it going to be okay at the end? 

Being an international student and having no friend at school is very sad honestly and there’s only a handful of people that I could share this but most of them don’t even relate. I felt that I could just post this here. Hopefully someone can relate to me.

I have applied for the DV lottery visa but it’s a really really small chance. I also have an American boyfriend who I’ve been in a relationship with two years now and we’re very serious. I know about his parents and he knows my family as well. He keeps joking about oh if you don’t get a job then you can just marry me to get a green card. As much as I love him and I want future for both of us I think that marrying him to get green card is also the last option that I would choose just because I don’t wanna go back and see that the only reason I got a green card is because of him and not me working hard or from my job. I know a lot of American people avoid us just because they think we’re dating them for green card and a part of them is also scared. And I don’t want my boyfriend to feel that about me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just so overwhelmed. My parents literally know nothing of how stressed I am because I don’t want to put that burden on them when they are already financing me. I know a lot of people are also in the same stage as me where you don’t know what to do or you might have already gone through this phase. Like is it going to be okay at the end? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an international student and having no friend at school is very sad honestly and there’s only a handful of people that I could share this but most of them don’t even relate. I felt that I could just post this here. Hopefully someone can relate to me.  &lt;/p&gt;

In these times, my recommendation will be to optimize your application effort. 

1. Focus more on connecting through your alumni and other contacts. 

2. Focus mainly on cities where immigrants are in plenty. As most companies there will be more likely to hire visa folks. In states like Ohio for example, HR of lot of companies will not even understand OPT. 

3. Lastly, while you keep applying for your dream roles. Put in some effort for short term roles as well. As even most of Fortune 500 companies are not hiring full time, and managing with temporary contract employees for now. So, apply for contract jobs as well, do not ignore them. 

4. All other things that a typical job hunting requires, like get resume reviewed by people, customize resume for each role, mock interviews always apply.

The ongoing teacher shortage in the U.S. creates opportunities for international candidates in elementary, middle, and high schools. Here's what you need to know:

# Why Teaching is a Strong Option for F1 Visa Holders

1. **H1B Eligibility**: Teaching positions qualify as “specialty occupations,” which makes them eligible for H1B visas. Many public school teaching jobs are also cap-exempt, meaning they are not subject to the annual H1B visa limits. This significantly improves your chances of obtaining a visa.
2. **Start Immediately on OPT/STEM OPT**: If you’re on OPT or STEM OPT, you can start working in a teaching position right away. School districts can sponsor your H1B visa while you are already employed.

# Steps to Take

1. **Meet State Requirements**:
   * Most teaching positions require a bachelor’s degree in education or a related field.
   * Some states may also require a teaching license or certification. If you don’t have one, many districts offer pathways for provisional or emergency certifications, allowing you to work while completing the requirements.
2. **Search for Jobs in Larger School Districts**:
   * Focus on districts in major cities or counties. Larger districts typically have more resources and experience in sponsoring H1B visas.
   * During the application process, verify that the district offers visa sponsorship and has a process for applying for H1B visas.
3. **Apply Strategically**:
   1. H1B Visa Eligibility: Teaching positions qualify as “specialty occupations,” making them eligible for H1B sponsorship. Many public school teaching roles are cap-exempt, meaning they are not subject to the annual H1B visa limits.
   2. Path to Permanent Residency: Many large school districts in the U.S. not only sponsor H1B visas but also provide pathways to permanent residency (Green Card). This is especially true in states with significant teacher shortages.
   1. Meet State Requirements:
      * A bachelor’s degree in education or a related field is typically required.
      * Some states may require a teaching license or certification. If you don’t have one, many districts provide options for provisional or emergency certifications that allow you to work while completing licensing requirements.
   2. Target Large Texas School Districts:
      * Personal Example: I applied to Dallas ISD as an F1 student 10 years ago and successfully transitioned to permanent residency by 2020.
      * Other major districts in Texas, such as Houston ISD, San Antonio ISD, and Austin ISD, are known for hiring international teachers and offering pathways to permanent residency. These districts often have well-established processes for sponsoring visas and supporting international hires.
   3. Start Working Immediately:
      * If you are on OPT or STEM OPT, you can begin working in a teaching position right away. Many districts will sponsor your H1B visa while you are employed.

I wanted to share my experience in case anyone finds themselves in a similar situation. A couple of weeks ago, I had a tragic experience while traveling in Spain, and I hope my journey can offer some guidance and reassurance to anyone who might face something similar.

# The Incident

On December 24th, 2024, I was robbed at the Barcelona airport. My bag was stolen, and along with it, my passports (one renewed and the other with my F1 Visa), all my credit cards, cash, and my laptop. Needless to say, I was horrified. However, staying calm and knowing the next steps is key—though overwhelming, it all works out in the end.

# Step 1: Report the Theft

The first thing I did was file a police report, ensuring that I included every detail of the items stolen. This was crucial, especially for insurance purposes and proving the theft to authorities later on.

# Step 2: Get a New Passport

The next step was to get a new passport. I went to the Indian Embassy in Spain, and there were two options:

1. **Emergency Certificate**: This would allow me to fly back to India and apply for a new passport there.
2. **Regular Passport**: A new passport issued in Spain, though it would have only a one-year validity.

I opted for the **regular passport** as it would help me apply for my US Visa faster without the hassle of going through the entire passport renewal process back in India. My new passport was issued by December 27th, 2024.

# Step 3: Apply for a New US Visa

Losing a US Visa means you have to go through the entire visa application process again. This includes filling out the DS-160 form, scheduling a biometric appointment, and attending an interview.

I contacted the US Embassy in Spain, and they advised me to pay the visa fee and book a slot, telling me that appointments could be available within a couple of weeks. However, when I attempted to schedule the appointment, I found there were no available slots for the next 10+ years. This was extremely disheartening, especially since I had only a week left on my vacation before I had to report back to my employer.

# Step 4: Fly Back to India

With no options available in Spain, my only choice was to fly back to India and reapply for my US Visa. During the flight, I filled out a new DS-160 form, and upon landing in India, I immediately reached out to visa agents to help me secure an expedited appointment.

It wasn’t easy, but after a lot of back-and-forth, I managed to get a slot for October 2025. Luckily, my agent was able to submit an emergency request, which resulted in a visa appointment on January 1st or 2nd, 2025. This was ideal, and I felt much more hopeful.

# Step 5: Visa Interview

The day of the visa interview, I made sure to bring all the necessary documents. I shared my entire story with the officer, explaining the theft and the steps I had taken to resolve the situation. The interview was smooth, and the officer only asked for my **I-20** and **passport**—nothing else.

On January 7th, 2025, I received my visa, and the next day I flew back to the US. The entire process, from getting a new passport to attending the interview, took a little over two weeks, but it was worth it.

# Step 6: Immigration

Upon arrival in the US, I was prepared for a secondary inspection due to the stolen and replaced passport. However, the immigration process went smoothly. The officers were sympathetic to my situation and stamped my passport without issue.

If I can get through this, so can you. While it was a stressful and challenging experience, taking one step at a time and staying calm helped me navigate this difficult situation. I hope this post helps anyone who finds themselves in a similar predicament—remember, it's tough, but there is always a way forward.

Also, please remember that this is going to cost you a lot, my rough estimation for the cost is also mentioned for reference. 

New Passport- 300EUR

US Visa fee in Spain - 190EUR

US Visa fee in India - 185$

Agent fee - INR 25000

Flight tickets to and fro Spain to Delhi, Delhi to NYC - 2400$ (Since it was New years time and last minute tickets)

Good luck to all, and stay safe! Feel free to reach out if you need any other assistance, I understand how tough this can be but please stay strong, if I can do it, so can you. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share my experience in case anyone finds themselves in a similar situation. A couple of weeks ago, I had a tragic experience while traveling in Spain, and I hope my journey can offer some guidance and reassurance to anyone who might face something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Incident&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 24th, 2024, I was robbed at the Barcelona airport. My bag was stolen, and along with it, my passports (one renewed and the other with my F1 Visa), all my credit cards, cash, and my laptop. Needless to say, I was horrified. However, staying calm and knowing the next steps is key—though overwhelming, it all works out in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step 1: Report the Theft&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was file a police report, ensuring that I included every detail of the items stolen. This was crucial, especially for insurance purposes and proving the theft to authorities later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step 2: Get a New Passport&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to get a new passport. I went to the Indian Embassy in Spain, and there were two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergency Certificate&lt;/strong&gt;: This would allow me to fly back to India and apply for a new passport there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular Passport&lt;/strong&gt;: A new passport issued in Spain, though it would have only a one-year validity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opted for the &lt;strong&gt;regular passport&lt;/strong&gt; as it would help me apply for my US Visa faster without the hassle of going through the entire passport renewal process back in India. My new passport was issued by December 27th, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step 3: Apply for a New US Visa&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing a US Visa means you have to go through the entire visa application process again. This includes filling out the DS-160 form, scheduling a biometric appointment, and attending an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted the US Embassy in Spain, and they advised me to pay the visa fee and book a slot, telling me that appointments could be available within a couple of weeks. However, when I attempted to schedule the appointment, I found there were no available slots for the next 10+ years. This was extremely disheartening, especially since I had only a week left on my vacation before I had to report back to my employer.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone,

I’m currently on STEM OPT and working a legit job at a good company. Here’s my situation:

About a year ago, I lost my F1 visa passport. I filed a police report and took care of everything to document the loss. I now have my new passport and all the necessary documents.

I really miss my siblings and want to visit India. However, since my original F1 visa was in the lost passport, I’d need to attend a new f1 visa stamping interview to return to the U.S.

A bit more context:
	•	My entire stay in the U.S. has been clean—I’ve followed all regulations and never engaged in illegal work.
	•	I worked hard to secure internships and ultimately land my current job.
	•	I’ve maintained my status and have no gaps or issues in my immigration record.

I’m concerned about the potential risks of leaving the U.S. for stamping, especially considering the current political climate and upcoming presidential changes.

Is it worth the risk to travel to India for stamping, or should I wait? I’d really appreciate any advice or personal experiences anyone can share.

Thank you in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I am just writing this to explain how I got it done.

Context: I am from Kenya but my family live in Qatar. I went to high school in Qatar but I am not a resident there anymore so I had to get a visitor visa to go back and visit family during my December work break and renew my F1. Because I’m not a current resident there, I didn’t qualify for Dropbox so I had to do an interview. Interview wait times were 2 days consistently for the last 6 months so I was optimistic. Qatar has a large expatriate population so it’s very common for most visa applicants to apply for visas as third country nationals.

Timeline 

December 27th: My interview request was received at the Doha consulate, had to wait for approval since I requested it on the weekend.

December 29th: Got an email that my interview was approved and I could schedule it. Tried to log back into traveldocs but my account was suspended for up to 72 hours for “suspicious activity”. This was probably because I was checking the website at least 6-8 times a day and on different devices. Please do not do what I did!! For a brief moment I thought this would be my downfall and I’d be screwed if interview dates regressed and I would not be able to schedule one.

December 31st: Luckily I got access into my account after 32 hours and scheduled the interview for Jan 6th!

January 6th: interview. Questions asked: What is your purpose of travel? When did you graduate? What is your current role? Visa approved!

January 7th: visa issued

January 8th: picked up passport.

Overall, I’m glad I was able to come back and see my family, I felt trapped in the US. Nobody knows what the Trump administration will hold, but I’m happy I was able to do this before. Good luck to anyone else who might be trying to renew it!

Hello,

My employer is sponsoring me, and I am currently transitioning from F1 student status to becoming a Green Card holder. We have completed all the necessary steps so far. My I-140 has been approved, and I have applied for both the I-765 and I-485. My fingerprints have also been taken.

My concern is that the semester is starting soon, with classes beginning in about three weeks. Do I still need to attend school to maintain my F1 status, or can I wait?

What happens if, in the meantime, my I-765 is approved and my work authorization card is issued?

I would like to continue school, but the tuition for F1 students is extremely expensive, and I can’t afford it this semester.

&gt;We changed your 2021 Form 1040-NR because of recent tax laws, rulings, or regulations required us to correct your Recovery Rebate Credit. As a result, you are due a refund of $1,400.00.

I was wondering if anyone else received the same. This makes me suspect, in contrast to what I thought and discussed earlier in that sub-reddit, that we are actually eligible now.

**EDIT**: Although the official IRS announcement in December does not confirm if that stimulus amount is for both resident and non-resident aliens, it however does indicate that individuals who did not claim a recovery rebate during 2021 tax year will receive one now ([LINK](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-special-payments-going-this-month-to-1-million-taxpayers-who-did-not-claim-2021-recovery-rebate-credit-encourages-non-filers-about-approaching-deadline-to-claim-credits)).

**EDIT 2:** This might be a long shot but I believe there is a remote possibility that there could be a policy change, allowing NRAs to receiving stimulus checks. This happened previously, in the case of Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF), for instance. International students were initially ineligible to receive funds for the first two rounds of disbursement, but were eligible to receive during the third round. I have received $1200 during HEERF III. While HEERF III (Dept. of Education) and stimulus checks (IRS) are not related, I suspect the changes to HEERF may be applied to the stimulus checks.

I’m seeking advice regarding my fiancée’s situation as she plans to travel back to the USA on STEM OPT. Here's the context:

She is on a valid STEM OPT and holds a valid F1 visa.

She has an active SEVIS status and an EAD card.

Her I-20 includes her employer's information, but the travel signature was issued on June 26th, making it over 6 months old now (technically expired for travel purposes just 3 days ago).

The university is currently closed for the holidays, so she couldn’t get the travel signature renewed before her flight.


Documents She Will Carry:

Valid passport (6+ months validity).

Valid F1 visa.

Valid STEM OPT EAD card.


My Concerns:

The expired travel signature on her I-20.

How much weight CBP officers at the port of entry give to an expired signature if all other documents are in order.

Whether she might be denied entry or placed in secondary inspection.


Questions:

1. Has anyone traveled back to the USA in a similar situation on STEM OPT?


2. Would the expired I-20 signature be a significant issue if she has all other valid documents?



I’d really appreciate any insights or advice on whether it’s okay for her to travel or if we should consider rescheduling her flight. Thanks so much in advance!



Edit: Her university was able to get her a new i20 thankfully so things are sorted now.

I am graduating on December 31st (on paper) and had applied for ead in November and gotten it approved and apparently had my card delivered on December 6 but I never got it . My apartment has a community Center where mails are received and the only thing they handed over to me was the approval notice but never the EAD card . I did not check the portal as I got busy with end semester stuff and thought my EAD card should reach by December 20 (2 weeks after approval notice ) and I will look into that then but I just checked today and it said my card was delivered at my reception area and I have a mail from my apartment stating I picked up that package with that tracking number ( read EAD card tracking ) but I don’t have it . I have filled for a replacement application on uscis today ! I need to know what’s the average processing time for people who apply for EAD now . My start date is Feb 10 in my opt .

UPDATE 1: I annoyed the f out of my apartment complex and went in myself to check if I could find the mail and lo and behold, it was lying in the corner of the room  . I don’t know if I should be happy that I found it or sad that I paid extra again for the refilling fees ? Will call uscis to inform them about this situation though !

UPDATE 2: UPDATE 2:

I realized this situation happens to a lot of people, and it’s completely understandable to panic. I was in the same shoes. If you are going through something similar, here is my advice:

If your EAD card was not delivered, first, take a deep breath. It’s going to be okay. Then, check if USPS marked it as delivered. When you apply for an EAD, it’s a good idea to enable Informed Delivery so you can track your mail.

If you cannot find your card, reapply as soon as possible, especially if your start date is within a month. USCIS can take up to a month to respond to your inquiry, and in most cases, they cannot retrieve the lost card.

When putting in the new application for the EAD, make sure to upload a copy of the already approved EAD with your application. If it is not peak season, you should receive a new approval within a month.

While waiting for the new card, you can start working using the acceptance notice for up to 90 days, but this depends on whether your employer accepts it. If you find your old card while waiting for the new one and your start date has arrived, you can begin working with the old card. However, once the new card arrives, you must update your employer with the new details.

Most employers understand this situation, so communicate with them as needed, and please call USCIS to talk to them—it really helps you navigate this better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

USCIS has issued a notice of intent to deny (NOID) their Form I-765, citing concerns about the program structure and their physical attendance.


Here’s the situation:

• My friend resides in a different state while their school is in different state

• USCIS claims their SEVIS record and the school’s I-17 form indicate the school is only approved for in-person Master’s programs, not hybrid ones.

•They were enrolled in a program where some classes may have been online or hybrid, but USCIS is requesting evidence to prove physical attendance, including:

◦ A statement from the DSO confirming their physical presence.

	◦ Course syllabi detailing delivery methods.

	◦ Attendance records for all classes attended.

	◦ Proof of tuition payments, recent transcripts, and progress towards graduation.

	◦ Travel/lodging information to prove commutes from Memphis to Marion (if applicable).

	◦ Evidence that the program was SEVP-certified for hybrid at the time of enrollment.

We’re also trying to figure out next steps in case USCIS ultimately denies the application:

	1.If their OPT application is denied, can they enroll in a new master’s program to maintain their F-1 status?
	2 .If they need to renew their F-1 visa, what are the chances of approval, especially if they go to a third country like Canada or Mexico for the interview?
	3 .How many days would they have to leave the U.S. if their application is denied and they don’t maintain F-1 status through another program?
	4 .Would transferring to a new SEVP-approved program improve their chances of successfully staying in the U.S. or renewing their visa?

This is a time-sensitive issue, and any insights or experiences with similar situations would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks so much for your help!

I’m an international student currently in the U.S., having just completed my first semester of a master’s program. I was recently offered an unpaid internship at an NGO, but when I inquired about paperwork, they said they’d classify it as a volunteer position for now, since I haven’t completed the required two semesters to be eligible for CPT (Curricular Practical Training). They also mentioned that if they like my work, they might turn it into a proper internship over the summer.

I’ve already consulted my university’s international office, but they couldn’t give me a clear answer on whether it’s okay to start this as a volunteer right now.

A few concerns:
	1.	Is it safe to pursue this “volunteer” position legally? I don’t want to risk my F-1 visa status.
	2.	Does doing an unpaid internship (or volunteering) affect my chances of getting an H1B visa in the future with another employer?

I have noticed that some of my seniors have similar experiences listed on their LinkedIn profiles, but unfortunately, I haven’t been able to get in touch with them to clarify how they managed it.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or has advice on how to proceed? I want to make sure I stay compliant with visa rules but also don’t want to miss out on this opportunity.

I’m an international student facing a complicated situation in my final quarter, and I’d really appreciate any advice or insights. Here’s my situation:

I’m currently in my final quarter and registered part-time under the Reduced Course Load policy. Unfortunately, I got a D in a required course, and this course isn’t offered until Spring 2025. This is the last course required for graduation and I have submitted both my DDA and OPT application (not yet approved).

Steps I’ve Taken So Far:

**1) Contacted my department advisors:**

\- They suggested I take an alternative upper-division course in Winter.

\- They also suggested I consider switching to another major within the same department. If I do that, the course I failed would no longer be required, and I could graduate after switching majors.

**2) Contacted my school’s international student office:**

\- They told me I could keep my current OPT application and remain in the U.S. until Spring to finish the course.

\- I asked if it’s possible to withdraw my OPT application, switch majors, and then reapply with a new I-20. The advisor mentioned they hadn’t seen a case like this before.

**Questions:**

1) Is it possible to withdraw an OPT application and reapply with a new I-20 after changing majors? Are there risks or challenges I should expect?

2) Is keeping my current OPT application and staying in the U.S. to finish the course in Spring feasible? Won’t it mess with the grace period as I am not having a job offer?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I left my home country( South Africa) when I was just 19 years old to be an au pair. I did the whole au pair thing for a year and boy was it tough. I didn’t really enjoy my experience but obviously stuck it through because I didn’t want to give up. While I was au pairing I met my boyfriend with 3 months left in the country. Obviously he knew this but we continued to date, I always knew I would return home. Prior to meeting him I had no desire to stay in the states. I ended up leaving and was gone for a month however my bf and I were still together doing long distance. Time goes on and he buys me a plane ticket to visit him, I wasn’t home for long and frankly I don’t think I fully settled into being home but I missed him so I hopped on a plane and visited him. Long story I applied to school in the states and got in. I’m now on a student visa and attending CC here but I can’t help but think of what my life would have been if I was in SA. Life here is hard. Exceptionally hard. I am not the happy person I was once, I am constantly under stress, sad, homesick and lonely. While I was an au pair I thought things would get better if I started college and socialised with others, but it hasn’t. Being in CC it’s hard to make friends and evening going out is expensive and I don’t have money for it. Tuition here is twice the price it would be in my home country so all my money and parents money goes into that. Besides money I only feel happy or like I have a life when I’m with my bf and that makes me sad. I’m 21 with no friends, a job I hate, living with my previous host family- so no space and broke!!! 
I justify staying here because of school, what an American college degree could do for my future. I want a career in politics like high level politics however I do intend on working in government in SA so I also am not actively learning about my country’s politics but instead the US. Which probably doesn’t matter but it makes me question why am I still here. 
In addition the cost of everything stresses me out. It’s too much on me and my parents tell me they can make it work but I know deep down it’s insane. They are good parents AMAZING actually and they’ve done their best to give me the world but I feel like it’s becoming too much- again they haven’t said it either. 
all in all I don’t know what to do. The cons outweigh the pros: Stress, depressed, lonely, isolated from family, bad quality of life
Pros: BF and American Education
but tbh I love my school and I’m grateful however the quality of education I’m receiving isnt OUT OF THIS WOLRD😭 like I went to a good high school and some of my course in college feel like HS work.

The issue is that the final for the class has already happened, I sent the instructor an email explaining my situation and hoping she will add me back and just fail me for the class instead and that would fix the problem but I am not sure since I might also be put on probation or drop status if that happens and that might also lead to the termination of my F1. 

The 19th is also the last day of classes and I don't know if that is helpful or not. I was planning on going back to my home country on the 22nd. 

One option I read was that I can apply for a new I-20 but will I have to drop out or transfer schools? Also how long will that take since I don't want to take a gap semester and initially planned to come back on the 17th of Jan. 

Moreover, my current f-1 is still valid hence I am on a 'warning period' and have until 19th to fix the issue but that is the day that the semester also ends. I plan to meet with the ISSS on Monday. 

I am sorry if this post is really confusing but I am really freaking out and also have finals right now.

Hi everyone,

I recently received my approved post-completion OPT EAD, which starts on January 6, 2025. However, I cannot begin my job until January 16, 2025. With some free time before my start date, I’m considering visiting my home country. However, given recent travel advisories from universities related to potential policy changes under the incoming administration, I’m uncertain about the risks of traveling at this time.

I plan to re-enter the U.S. on January 14 with the following documents:
	•	A valid visa
	•	Physical EAD card
	•	Job offer letter (start date: January 16, 2025)
	•	Signed I-20 (note: the employer name will not be included on the I-20 at the time of reentry)

I have a couple of questions:

	1.	Has anyone on OPT EAD recently re-entered the U.S. with just an offer letter? If so, could you share your experience?

	2.	While I understand I’m allowed 90 days of unemployment, will the ~10 unemployed days I spend outside the U.S. prior to starting my job create any issues during reentry?

I'm reaching out for advice on a friend's situation. She's been living in the US for over 15 years with her parents and siblings, who are now US citizens. She completed her Bachelor's and Master's degrees on an F-1 visa. After working on an H-1B visa, she recently lost her job.

I was supposed to graduate with the 2020 batch, but due to COVID-19, the final exams were delayed and held in 2021. The results were published in 2022. During this time, I mostly worked as a freelancer. Since my bachelor’s degree is in physics, I got accepted into an MS program in physics and plan to build a career in astrophysics.

Most of my work experience was remote. On someone's advice, I focused on listing research activities, online courses, and training I pursued after graduating in 2022, instead of including freelance work on my profile.

During an interview today, the visa officer (VO) asked me what I had been doing over the past four years. At that moment, I didn’t fully understand the question but later realized what they meant. I responded that I had been involved in learning, including exploring quantum computing. The VO then asked how I supported myself financially during this time. I explained that I relied on my mother’s financial support.

I also mentioned that my mother is not emotionally strong due to the loss of my father in 2015, and I had to support her, which is why I didn’t take on a full-time job. Additionally, my MS program offers a teaching assistantship (TA) starting from the spring semester. However, the TA for the upcoming semesters has not been distributed yet.

My graduate advisor provided a letter of support explaining the department's policy of supporting international students for two years. It also stated that I would be joining his research group in the next semester with summer funding. If this funding were reflected in my I-20, it would show a surplus of over $4,000. However, the current I-20 shows a $17,000 deficit with 57% funding because my TA contract is only for six months at the moment.

Now, if my department offers me full-year funding in the spring or fall semester, should I update my DS-160 with my previous job experiences, especially those that are relevant? Additionally, should I continue with this university if they offer full-year funding?

I wanted to share my F1 visa interview experience at the New Delhi consulate earlier today. My application for the Master's in Computer Science with a Data Science Specialization at the University of Southern California (USC) was unfortunately refused, and I’m trying to understand what might have gone wrong.

The interview was conducted by an African American visa officer. I greeted her warmly with a smile and said, ""Good morning, officer,"" but she didn’t seem very receptive. After asking for my passport, I explained that I was transitioning from the University of Arizona to USC and provided a detailed explanation of why this change aligned with my academic goals.

She asked me several questions about my interest in data science and my specific area of focus. I confidently answered, explaining my niche research topic and how it ties into the work I’ve done during undergrad, including publishing two papers. I also highlighted that there’s a professor at USC whose research aligns perfectly with my goals, making the program an ideal fit for me.

Despite answering everything clearly and to the best of my ability, the officer seemed disengaged and even repeated a question about my focus in data science. I reiterated my points, emphasizing my research background and passion for collaboration at USC. In the end, she acknowledged my explanation but still refused my visa.

I’m curious if others applying for the Spring intake, especially to programs like USC’s, have faced similar issues. Given USC’s stellar reputation, it feels strange to be refused, and I wonder if there’s been a pattern of rejections this season.

I’d appreciate any insights or advice, especially from those who’ve been through something similar.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Fam,

&lt;p&gt;If worst case there is a travel ban (I’m from India) what would be my options, can I continue my final semester ( its a hybrid course) in India and then come back once the ban is lifted? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot! &lt;/p&gt;

1. Will applying for a new F-1 visa on my Jordanian passport raise any concerns or issues during the visa adjudication process, given my I-20 citizenship is the West Bank?

I don’t know, but if I don’t get work experience here I feel like I just wasted the money. I don’t think the few research opportunities I had was worth the 240k I spent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not feeling hopeful that I can land a job. A lot of my friends who are smarter than me are struggling, and I’m just wondering if it’s even worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

This happened during my STEM OPT renewal process, and I received a  RFE/NOID (Notice of Intent to Deny) due to a prior DUI. I’ll walk through my timeline and how I handled it, but please, no hate comments—this is just for reference.

# Timeline:

* **April 30, 2024** – Applied for STEM OPT extension
* **September 11, 2024** – Request for additional evidence cancelled for Form I-765
* **September 13, 2024** – Received Request for Initial Evidence (RFE) for Form I-765 via USCIS portal

* **October 11, 2024** – My attorney mailed the response with documentation
* **October 14, 2024** – I uploaded the same documentation to USCIS portal
* **October 19, 2024** – Form I-765 **Approved**

# Background:

I want to clarify that before applying for my initial OPT, I had no issues. However, during my STEM OPT renewal, I received the NOID because of a prior DUI conviction. USCIS was considering prudential revocation of visa.

I spoke to multiple law firms, many of which had never dealt with a situation like this and were not very confident about the outcome. After some research, I decided to go with Murthy Law, and I’m really glad I did. Their team is strong, organized, and very thorough in complex cases.

Just ensure you have all the documentation ready from your side - Proof of completion of courses, Fines/Fee paid, Certified copies of court judgment and any other record, Also share the documents whatever you think may have a positive influence to your attorney, Like job/promotions etc., I was asked to add few testimonies from family and friend and a response was prepared using all of the above documentations adding their expertise in immigration law

# Final Thoughts:

1. Ask DSO to reach out to USCIS and SEVIS support.

2. File a typographical error e-request on the USCIS website. [Link here](https://egov.uscis.gov/e-request/displayTypoForm.do?sroPageType=typoError&amp;entryPoint=init)

3. Reach out to your local congressmen's office and explain your situation. USCIS has special people dedicated to addressing requests from the congressmen's offices so your case will get quick and serious attention.

4. Reach out to the USCIS Ombudsmen. [Link here](https://www.dhs.gov/case-assistance)

5. Create a package of all documents(SEVIS record, denial notice, i20, a letter from you and a letter from your DSO explaining there was a administrative error and you are requesting a correction) and send it to the USCIS office (Address is on the denial notice).

If all this does not work, consider filing a motion, but keep that as your last option, since it is unnecessary for this kind of a case, and super expensive. Keep your DSO in the loop constantly. Talk to 3-4 different immigration attorneys.

If you are in a similar situation, I understand how devastating it feels. Try your best not to panic and get all the help you can and use all resources available to you. You got this!

I graduated in May 2024, applied for OPT on april 22nd, got an RFE on aug 23rd because I missed attaching my Passport, responded to RFE in october, and on nov 15 got a denial notice saying my DSO did not send the recommendation in time.

BUT my DSO showed me my SEVIS history it shows that the recommendation was sent in time.

They said "" It looks to us like your application was incorrectly denied.  I have attached the event history of your SEVIS record. You can see that I submitted the OPT recommendation on April 16th and it was not canceled by  
anyone on our staff. You can see in the event history that your record auto-completed in October. This occurred because your record did not show OPT approval or pending status because USCIS's system and the SEVIS sy stem did not properly communicate the status of your application. Our only guess is that  
USCIS saw the completion and thought the recommendation was not submitted.

We also find it strange that the recommendation was not mentioned in the RFE  
that you received in October. If it was determined to be an issue, then it

Hi everyone. My husband's and my passports expired back in August. I'm on STEM OPT and eventually, I need to have them renewed for whatever the reason may be.

Has anyone ever had their passport renewed by mailing it to their country's embassy in the US? I know my country has an embassy in Washington and wanted to know a few things:

1) Approximate time to get the renewed passport back.
2) Whether they would give back the old passport as well since it contains the visa stamp.
3) Ease of this route.

To be honest, I am scared that they would either lose our passports in the mail OR won't return the old passports with the visa stamps, whether on purpose or by accident, then they get lost or destroyed, and no way to get them back.

Need to make sure that they KNOW they need to send back the old passports.

Sorry, getting paranoid a bit as this is a huge thing.

Any advice? Any other methods to renew a passport without losing the visa stamp?

Thanks!

""We have taken an action on your case"". My heart was racing as I entered my password on USCIS.gov. Is it an RFE or is it an approval? 

I have never been slightly worried about my 3 prior OPT applications until I started reading this sub. 

Never paid for premium processing either. I only uploaded the latest I-20. No laundry list of 10 I-20s to confuse the adjudicator.

I shouldn't have been stressed about it. But this sub made me stressed. On November 6 this year, I uploaded all my I-20s, even though it isn't necessary and I've never done so.

The USCIS messages kind of evolved over the years. 

My applications were all approved within 3 months. Both my bachelor's and master's universities run on the quarter system. So, that certainly helped.

Use premium processing only if you need to travel, not because you're worried. 

Educate yourself on F-1 and proof-read your applications many times. You have no reason to be denied if your application was filed correctly.

You shouldn't worry about RFE either if you are going to reputable universities.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got an email today. &amp;quot;We have taken an action on your case&amp;quot;.

I’m considering enrolling in a graduate program at the same university where I completed my bachelor’s degree. My company offers some financial support for graduate programs, which is a nice perk. My question is, since I would have to wait until my OPT ends to start the program, I’m planning to apply for the Spring 2026 semester. Would I be able to start right after my OPT ends? And would I still be eligible to work part-time for my current employer during that time?

I have a job offer from a company that’s willing to sponsor me, but I’ll have a 92-day gap between the start of my EAD and the job’s start date—just over the 90-day unemployment limit for OPT.

I’m currently majoring in Business Administration &amp; Economics, with concentrations in Finance and Accounting.

Would creating and running this channel count as self-employment under OPT rules? And if so, would it stop the ""unemployment days"" clock?

Also, is it feasible to continue working on OPT and maintain the YouTube business simultaneously, or should I plan to shut it down once I start my job?

Thanks in advance for any guidance!

**EDIT 11/13/24:** My program end date on I-20 is different from the graduation date, and I would not have any issues with unemployment clock. I have opened the ticket with the DSO, and waiting for their response. Will update post afterwards.

Hey everyone. I have a trip planned to come from the US back to my home country to have my f1 visa interview, since I’m aging out of my L2 visa (dependent). Tell me if I’m overthinking, but I’m worrying about getting approved from my interview. Some context of what’s changed in my life since moving to the US alone 3 years ago: I now live with my parents (having L1 and L2 visas and jobs here) and sister(dependent visa). I moved from a different city with my roommates to now living with my family. We also got a house last year. And I’ve been very proactive in my school’s program and have a bunch of ECs as well (I’m part of a church server group, food bank volunteer, and school org officer).

Am I overthinking that they’ll think I’ll have too many ties here and have intentions of immigrating? This whole election got me more stressed than anything lol🥲 Any thoughts would help. Thank you:)

UPDATE:
Update, got back to the US with my F1🤞🏻. It was an unusual case for some as it seems like it’s somewhat guaranteed since an L2 is already a non immigrant visa, just like B2 or an F1 which I have had already.

But thanks for the kind wishes🥹 My turn now to wish y’all an amazing semester and successful accomplishment of y’all’s degrees!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPDATED BELOW&lt;/p&gt;

Some context of what’s changed in my life since moving to the US alone 3 years ago: I now live with my parents (having L1 and L2 visas and jobs here) and sister(dependent visa). I moved from a different city with my roommates to now living with my family. We also got a house last year. And I’ve been very proactive in my school’s program and have a bunch of ECs as well (I’m part of a church server group, food bank volunteer, and school org officer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I overthinking that they’ll think I’ll have too many ties here and have intentions of immigrating? This whole election got me more stressed than anything lol🥲 Any thoughts would help. Thank you:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:
Update, got back to the US with my F1🤞🏻. It was an unusual case for some as it seems like it’s somewhat guaranteed since an L2 is already a non immigrant visa, just like B2 or an F1 which I have had already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thanks for the kind wishes🥹 My turn now to wish y’all an amazing semester and successful accomplishment of y’all’s degrees!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m currently on STEM OPT with my F-1 visa valid until June 2026. I’m planning to travel to my home country from **November 16th** until **January 22nd** (about 67 days). My employer has approved remote work during this period, and I’ll be taking some occasional time off as well. My company will be closed for both Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays (around 10days excluding weekends), so this extended trip allows me to combine personal time with the holidays. My payroll will continue to run in the U.S. throughout.

Here’s what I’m planning to bring for re-entry:

* Employer letter confirming my remote work approval, holiday closures, and occasional time off.
* Updated I-20 with a recent travel endorsement.
* Recent pay stubs to show continuous employment.

**Questions:**

1. Has anyone traveled for over a month on STEM OPT with remote work? Any advice on re-entering?
2. Will CBP have any issues with me working remotely from abroad temporarily, given that I’ll be back to the U.S. afterward?
3. Should I reschedule my return date a bit earlier somewhere around 1st week of January?

I’m an F-1 visa student studying finance and only two classes away from graduation (expected in May 2025). Unfortunately, I was in a serious car accident earlier this semester that left me with trauma, tremors, difficulty breathing and ongoing challenges, making it really difficult to attend in-person classes since I live one hour away from my college. I've been doing my best to attend remotely and keep up, but it hasn’t been easy.

Here’s where it gets complicated:

1. **Accommodation Challenges**: My school’s accommodation office has been supportive but needs further documentation (specifically from a psychologist) to continue accommodating me. Due to financial constraints, I can’t afford a psychologist right now to provide the required documentation, so I’m not sure how to move forward.
2. **F-1 Visa Concerns**: One of my professors has advised me to retake a critical class next fall (Fall 2025) due to the attendance and missed work. However, that would mean taking only one class, which wouldn’t meet the F-1 full-time enrollment requirements. I’m worried about how to stay compliant without risking my visa status.

I’ve reached out to both my advisor and the international office, but I’m still stuck in limbo without clear solutions. Has anyone dealt with something similar or have any advice on what else I could try? I’m open to any suggestions, whether it’s navigating university policies, finding affordable mental health resources, or figuring out visa compliance.

Any help or advice would be truly appreciated. Thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

My STEM OPT extension got denied. So here's what happened :-

My Initial OPT expired on June 29,2024

I filed my STEM OPT extension on June 27,2024. My application got rejected because of payment failure. I got a rejection letter stating that I should reapply with all the supporting documents. I contacted my DSO and she said to do the same even though it's past the deadline. 

So, I reapplied on July 3, 2024 with all the proof. The payment was accepted this time. The second application was submitted 3-4 days after my Initial OPT expiry date. I asked my DSO if it's fine and she said not to worry about it as we followed the rejection letter with supporting documents.

However, my STEM OPT got denied after waiting for almost 4 months. I got the denial letter and it says my application was recieved after my Initial OPT expired. It also says that my 1st application was rejected due to payment failure so it treats every application as new without holding anything from previous one.

I am screwed. What are my options now? Also do I still have a 60-days grace period? There are a lot of confusions regarding the grace period as well. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi !&lt;/p&gt;

Due to some personal emergency I have to travel to India. My travel duration is 2nd November to 16th November. I am currently working as a full time Software Engineer with my EAD expiring on Jan 15 2025.
I have listed documents for a smooth re entry :

1. Travel OPT
2. Employment Verification Letter
3. Pay stubs 
4. Valid Passport abd F1 visa 
5. Valid EAD card

I have not applied for STEM extension opt yet, I was planning to apply it end of November. But due to this emergency I couldn’t. I have read in few post that your travel date should not be closer to your EAD expiration date. As I haven’t filed for I-765 yet would it be a problem in the port of entry. 

Please suggest !

In a bad situation here. My EAD was scanned delivered by USPS but I never recieved it. Local post office says they will look for it but I'm not sure. I might have to end up applying for another card soon. If anyone has gone through this process please be kind to let me know what you know about the following.

1) Did you have to request a new I-20 from the DSO?
2) I believe I have to report it as a lost card for replacement. But, they do ask for previous EADs and since I lost it before recieving how did you go about this section.
3) There is an option in USCIS to inquire about the mail being not recieved. Did this help at all?
4) How long did the replacement take?

I assume speaking with a USCIS agent is not fruitfull. Thank you in advance!

EDIT: Thank you all for the answers. I found it. After several attempts of meeting the USPS personal in person, the mail carrier found it in someone else's mailbox. Reddit helped a lot when finding the answers. In summary what I did was (for someone who might be in the same situation):

1) Put down a request for missing mail (https://www.usps.com/help/missing-mail.htm) then go to USPS in person. Do not wait for them to get back to you. For me this happened one evening and I was at USPS next day at 8 AM. Tell them you are looking for a missing mail in an evelope. In my case they printed out my request then and there and handed it over to the mail man and told me that he would make my mailbox his first stop to see if he has made a wrong delivery. I made the mistake where I said, ""missing package"" since the USPS categorized the item as a package. The communication may have not been crip betwen employees and the mail man I believe ended up looking for a package (may be like a small box or a bubble mailer). Later I went back to the USPS and mentioned that it should be an envelope. That's how they found it. It says ""priority mail"" but a small gap in communication can make big issues.

2) In between the above events I went to the apartment leasing office and told them if they could send out an email to the residents in my apartment complex. They chose not to help me :( (They definitely could have because they do have a mass email system). But in most cases I would say they will. So I went from door step to door step, informing them about my situation. I live in a cluster of fourplexes so it wasn't that bad. 

When I returned to the USPS and explained that it was an envelope (which the carrier might have mistaken for a package), the lady at the desk contacted him directly and sent him a photo of the priority mail scan from when it first arrived at their facility. On my drive back home, the carrier called me directly to say that he found it. He even waited at the mailbox to hand it over in person. The USPS in my case went above and beyond to find the envelope. Whatever you do, do it fast before people pick up mail. In my case I was extremely lucky.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,

I’m currently a grad student on an F-1 visa. I’m in my last semester and have a full-time job offer from a company starting in a few weeks.

I'm trying to understand if it's possible to begin working full-time under Curricular Practical Training (CPT) for a month until I graduate and then transition to Optional Practical Training (OPT) after my graduation.

I am currently on my STEM OPT which ends in July’26, and just got offered two positions: 

Position A: Big research university, software engineer, very competitive salary, interesting work, No H1B sponsorship. 

PositionB: Community college, IT position, decent salary, not so interesting work, Cap exempt H1B on day 1.

I am very confused on which position would be good for my career and I would need advice on that. 

Is the cap exempt H1B worth it? How is one able to change their status from H1B cap exempt to exempt? If I were to get an H1B filed in a position which is not very interesting to me, would I be stuck in that position? 

Ideally, I would like to do a graduate degree but not immediately after my stem opt ends.

To start, I pursued a [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering. Post that for one year, while many of my friends worked in big companies or went abroad for Master's, I was still deciding what to do.

Then I realized I was good with coding and Analytical abilities and with a bit of experience working on a research project on AI &amp; ML, I applied to a Master's at a highly reputed college in the US and got admitted there for MS in Mechanical Engineering with a conc in AI &amp; ML.

During my Master's, I interned as an MLE at a startup, involving fast-paced and challenging work. I graduated and started the Job Hunt with good internship experiences on my resume and portfolio.

It didn't go well. It's been over a year and I'm still jobless. Although with extensive networking and constant reach-outs, I have interviews in hand most of the time and ace technical discussions, I get rejected due to a lack of experience or a hiring freeze. My initial F-1 OPT period got started and I'm not sure if it is purely a function of the job market or if I'm doing something wrong or if this is bad luck. Since I'm one year into the job hunt already, I'm confident I'm not going wrong anywhere.

Now, going forward, I have my initial OPT deadline coming up, and I need to file STEM OPT for things to go well. If things don't go as I expect, I might have to return to India. I have people saying I should join a consultancy, but I don't want to do that since it involves faking a lot of details.

Now, even if I have to return, I have to think of what to do when I go back.

I had a friend preparing for UPSC for three years but couldn't clear it. He dropped it, prepared for CAT, and is now at IIM-C. It was necessary for him since he needed a job, and he felt an MBA was a sure-shot route to get a job in India (I'm not sure how true this is and will appreciate perspectives here as well).

At this point, I don't know how to proceed. I see that the tech market will get more saturated and worse as the world progresses in the shorter run and am unsure if my hunt will yield anything positive given I put this effort again going back. Now, should I start searching for a job in India (uncertain of the Indian Job Market) or follow my friend and prep for CAT?

I know I sound a lot desperate and vague. I'm not in a position to waste any more years (I'm 25 years old now). But if I think about it, if I invest two more years which would lead me to a good career in the bigger picture, I can take that leap.

This is the kind of juggle I'm stuck with and I would appreciate any advice or perspectives on this.

My DSO terminated my SEVIS and asked me to enter US on a new I-20, so I did. She has also asked me to look for a new 9 months program after completion of my masters. By any chance, does anybody know any colleges that offer 9-months certificate programs for F1 Students so that I could directly go on OPT based on the certificate program? I have only found UCLA Extension as of now that is starting from April 2025. I need colleges that take spring intake from April.

Reason of violation: My internship was supposed to end on 9th September but on 4th September I got a new offer letter from my company as they wanted me to extend it till 25th Nov. I informed my co-op advisor and shared my new offer letter with her, and discussed the next steps.

On 23rd Sept. I received an email from Office of global services saying that they have approved my extension but I was unauthorized to work between 9th and 22nd sept so they told me to ask my advisor to update the date to 23rd instead of 9th sept. I reached out to my advisor and I asked her why they are saying that I was unauthorized to work and I hope it won't affect my visa status in any case then she said she is not aware of visa regulations she CCd the DSO on the email chain, and DSO asked me to stop working immediately, and then she terminated my SEVIS. Main issue is I was about graduate in 6 months but now I have to do one more degree to complete 9 months or 1 year so that I could be eligible for OPT.
