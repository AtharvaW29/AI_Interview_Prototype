Hello everyone, I got accepted into Rutgers for a Masters program and I still have my old F1 visa from my bachelors degree. I recently graduated in December 2024, and my visa will expire December 2025. I also recently applied for a B2 Visa in April to attend my graduation in May and got approved. I\u2019m wondering if I have to apply for a new Visa since this is a new school and new I20. Do I qualify for an interview waiver? Thank you.<|eot_id|>"

I'm currently on a J-1 visa in the U.S. I'm planning to apply for a Change of Status to F-1. My situation is: * Earliest date I can apply for COS on **August 17** * Classes will begin on **August 26** (only 9 days later) * Most likely, USCIS won't process it before that date My questions are: 1. Will USCIS **reject** the COS just because the I-20 start date is close or already passed by the time they review it? 2. If the start date passes, can I simply have the school **defer my I-20 to Spring**<|eot_id|>"

So my friend is on an F1 visa here in the U.S., and they\u2019re wondering if it\u2019s okay to accept prize money from an event that was held outside the U.S.. The thing is, the event was international, but the organization hosting it is based in the U.S. (like a U.S. sports league, just held outside the country). They won about $25,000 for the prize, but the real question is whether they\u2019re allowed to accept it, considering their F1 status. \u2022 It\u2019s not like a job or anything \u2014 it\u2019s just prize money. \u2022 Th<|eot_id|>"

Is there any other alternative for me besides to transfer to a University here or go home back to my country? Thank you.<|eot_id|>"

[Philippines] New required qualification for B1/B2 visa renewal? (14 years old and above)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nI understand your situation. As a visa officer, I need to ask you some questions. Hello! Is this a new required qualification for B1/B2 renewal? I don\u2019t remember seeing this before. \u201cI was previously issued any type of full validity U.S. visa (other than B1/B2) which is still valid or recently expired within the last 48 months.\u201d So if I was only issued a B1/B2 visa and not any other type of US visa, I won\u2019t qualify for the interview waiver anymore? Thank you!<|eot_id|>"

Hey Folks, I have submitted the visa scheduling application and paid the MRV fee for a dropbox appointment.

If I am not able to find a dropbox interview, what is the process to switch from dropbox interview to an in person interview ? 2. Will I have to pay the MRV fee again for in-person or can I re-use the fee paid for dropbox and switch to an in-person interview ? Thank<|eot_id|>"
